.SH DESCRIPTION
Environmental or clinical molecular diversity studies generate large
volumes of amplicons (e.g. SSU-rRNA sequences) that need to be checked
for chimeras, dereplicated, masked, sorted, searched, clustered or
compared to reference sequences. The aim of \fBvsearch\fR is to offer
a all-in-one open source tool to perform these tasks, using optimized
algorithm implementations and harvesting the full potential of modern
computers, thus providing fast and accurate data processing.
.PP
Comparing nucleotide sequences is at the core of \fBvsearch\fR. To
speed up comparisons, \fBvsearch\fR implements an extremely fast
implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, making use of the
Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE2) of modern x86-64 CPUs. If SSE2
instructions are not available, \fBvsearch\fR exits with an error
message. For comparisons involving sequences longer than 5,000
nucleotides, \fBvsearch\fR uses a slower alignment method with smaller
memory requirements.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Input
\fBvsearch\fR input is a fasta (or fastq) file containing one or
several nucleotide sequences. For each sequence, the sequence
identifier is defined as the string comprised between the ">" (or "@")
symbol and the first space, tab or the end of the line, whichever
comes first. Additionally, if the fasta header line starts with
">[;]size=\fIinteger\fR;label", contains
">label;size=\fIinteger\fR;label" or ends with
">label;size=\fIinteger\fR[;]", \fBvsearch\fR will remove the pattern
[;]size=\fIinteger\fR[;] from the header and interpret \fIinteger\fR
as the number of occurrences (or abundance) of the sequence in the
study. That abundance information is used or created during chimera
detection, clustering, dereplication, sorting and searching.
.PP
The nucleotide sequence is defined as a string of IUPAC symbols
(ACGTURYSWKMDBHVN), starting after the end of the identifier line and
ending before the next identifier line, or the file end. \fBvsearch\fR
silently ignores ascii characters 9 to 13, and exits with an error
message if ascii characters 0 to 8, 14 to 31, "." or "-" are
present. All other ascii or non-ascii characters are stripped and
complained about in a non-blocking warning message.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR operations are case insensitive, except when soft
masking is activated. When using clustering, masking or searching
commands, the case is important if soft masking is used. Soft masking
is specified with the options "\-\-dbmask soft" (for searching) or
"\-\-qmask soft" (for searching, clustering and masking). When using
soft masking, lower case letters indicate masked symbols, while upper
case letters indicate regular symbols. Masked symbols are never
included in the unique \fIk\fR-mers used in searching. When soft
masking is not activated, all letters are converted to upper case
internally and used in result files.
.PP
When comparing sequences during chimera detection, dereplication,
searching and clustering, T and U are considered identical, regardless
of their case. If two symbols are not identical, their alignment will
result in the negative mismatch score (default -4), except if one or
both of the symbols are ambiguous (RYSWKMDBHVN) in which case the
score is zero. Alignment of two identical ambiguous symbols (e.g. R vs
R) also receives a score of zero.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR can be compiled to accepted compressed fasta files as
input (gz and bzip2 formats). On the other hand, special files like
pipes, named pipes, or sockets cannot be used as input. To present a
progress indicator, \fBvsearch\fR needs to seek to the end of
\fIfilename\fR to find its length. Consequently, \fIfilename\fR must
be a regular file, not a stream.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Options
\fBvsearch\fR recognizes a large number of command-line options. For
easier navigation, options are grouped below by theme (chimera
detection, clustering, dereplication, masking, shuffling, sorting, and
searching). We start with general options that apply to all themes.
.PP
General options:
.RS
.TP 9
.BI \-\-fasta_width\~ "positive integer"
Fasta files produced by \fBvsearch\fR are wrapped (sequences are
written on lines of \fIinteger\fR nucleotides, 80 by default). Set
that value to 0 to eliminate the wrapping.
.TP
.B \-\-help | \-\-h
Display help text and exit.
.TP
.BI \-\-log \0filename
Write messages to the specified log file. Information written includes
program version, amount of memory available, number of cores and command
line options. The start and finish times are also recorded as well as
the elapsed time. The maximum amount of memory consumed is included.
The different commands will usually also write some information about
their results. Both fatal, warning and informational messages are
written.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxseqlength\~ "positive integer"
All \fBvsearch\fR operations will discard sequences of length equal or
greater than \fIinteger\fR (50,000 nucleotides by default).
.TP
.BI \-\-minseqlength\~ "positive integer"
All \fBvsearch\fR operations will discard sequences of length smaller
than \fIinteger\fR (1 nucleotide by default for sorting or shuffling,
32 nucleotides for clustering, dereplication or searching).
.TP
.B \-\-notrunclabels
Do not truncate sequence labels at first space or tab, use the full
header in output files.
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
Suppress all output to stdout and stdout except for warnings and fatal
error messages.
.TP
.BI \-\-threads\~ "positive integer"
Number of computation threads to use (1 to 256). The number of threads
should be lesser or equal to the number of available CPU cores. The
default is to use all available resources and to launch one thread
per logical core. The following commands are multi-threaded:
uchime_ref, cluster_fast, cluster_size, cluster_smallmem, maskfasta,
allpairs_global, usearch_global.
Only one thread is used for the other commands.
.TP
.B \-\-version | \-\-v
Output version information and exit.
.RE

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chimera detection options:
.PP
.RS
Chimera detection is based on a scoring function controlled by five
options (\-\-dn, \-\-mindiffs, \-\-mindiv, \-\-minh,
\-\-xn). Sequences are first sorted by decreasing abundance (if
available), and compared on their \fIplus\fR strand only (case
insensitive).
.PP
In \fIde novo\fR mode, input fasta file should present abundance
annotations (pattern [;]size=\fIinteger\fR[;] in the fasta
header). The input order influences the chimera detection, so we
recommend to sort sequences by decreasing abundance (default of
\-\-derep_fulllength command). If your sequence set needs to be
sorted, please see the \-\-sortbysize command in the sorting section.
.PP
.TP 9
.BI \-\-abskew \0real
When using \-\-uchime_denovo, the abundance skew is used to
distinguish in a 3-way alignment which sequence is the chimera and
which are the parents. The assumption is that chimeras appear later in
the PCR amplification process and are therefore less abundant than
their parents. The default value is 2.0, which means that the parents
should be at least 2 times more abundant than their chimera. Any
positive value greater than 1.0 can be used.
.TP
.BI \-\-alignwidth\~ "positive integer"
Width of the 3-way alignments in \-\-uchimealns output. The default
value is 80. Set to 0 to eliminate wrapping.
.TP
.BI \-\-borderline \0filename
Output borderline chimeric sequences to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta format.
Borderline chimeric sequences are sequences that have a high enough
score but which are not sufficiently diverged from their closest parent.
.TP
.BI \-\-chimeras \0filename
Output chimeric sequences to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta format. Output
order may vary when using multiple threads.
.TP
.BI \-\-db \0filename
When using \-\-uchime_ref, detect chimeras using the fasta-formatted
reference sequences contained in \fIfilename\fR. Reference sequences
are assumed to be chimera-free. Chimeras will not be detected if their
parents (or sufficiently close relatives) are not present in the
database.
.TP
.BI \-\-dn \0real
No vote pseudo-count (parameter \fIn\fR in the chimera scoring
function) (default value is 1.4).
.TP
.BI \-\-mindiffs\~ "positive integer"
Minimum number of differences per segment (default value is 3).
.TP
.BI \-\-mindiv \0real
Minimum divergence from closest parent (default value is 0.8).
.TP
.BI \-\-minh \0real
Minimum score (h). Increasing this value tends to reduce the number of
false positives and to decrease sensitivity. Default value is 0.28,
and values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 included are accepted.
.TP
.BI \-\-nonchimeras \0filename
Output non-chimeric sequences to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta
format. Output order may vary when using multiple threads.
.TP
.BI \-\-relabel \0string
Relabel sequences using the prefix \fIstring\fR and a ticker (1, 2, 3,
etc.) to construct the new headers. Use \-\-sizeout to conserve the
abundance annotations.
.TP
.B \-\-relabel_keep
When relabelling, keep the old identifier in the header after a space.
.TP
.B \-\-relabel_md5
Relabel sequences using the MD5 message digest algorithm applied to
the sequence to replace the header.
The sequence is converted to upper case and U is replaced by
T before the digest is computed.
The MD5 digest is a cryptographic hash function designed
to minimize the probability that two
different inputs will give the same output, even for very similar,
but non-identical inputs. Still, there will always be a small,
but non-zero, probability that two different inputs
will give the same result.
The MD5 digest generates a 128 bit (16 byte) result that is
represented by 32 hexadecimal digits (0123456789abcdef).
Use \-\-sizeout to conserve the abundance annotations.
.TP
.B \-\-relabel_sha1
Relabel sequences using the SHA1 message digest algorithm applied to
the sequence to replace the header. It is similar to the
\-\-relabel_md5 option but uses the SHA1 algorithm instead of the
MD5 algorithm.
The SHA1 digest generates a 160 bit (20 byte) result
that is represented by 40 hexadecimal digits.
The probability of a collision (two non-identical sequences
having the same digest) is smaller for the SHA1 algorithm
than for the MD5 algorithm.
.TP
.B \-\-self
When using \-\-uchime_ref, ignore a reference sequence when its label
matches the label of the query sequence (useful to estimate
false-positive rate in reference sequences).
.TP
.B \-\-selfid
When using \-\-uchime_ref, ignore a reference sequence when its
nucleotide sequence is strictly identical with the query sequence.
.TP
.B \-\-sizeout
Add abundance annotations to the output fasta file (with the pattern
";size=\fIinteger\fR;" to sequence headers) when relabelling.
.TP
.BI \-\-uchime_denovo \0filename
Detect chimeras present in the fasta-formatted \fIfilename\fR, without
external references (i.e. \fIde novo\fR). Automatically sort the
sequences in \fIfilename\fR by decreasing abundance beforehand (see
the sorting section for details). Multithreading is not supported.
.TP
.BI \-\-uchime_ref \0filename
Detect chimeras present in the fasta-formatted \fIfilename\fR by
comparing them with reference sequences (option
\-\-db). Multithreading is supported.
.TP
.BI \-\-uchimealns \0filename
Write the 3-way global alignments (parentA, parentB, chimera) to
\fIfilename\fR using a human-readable format. Use \-\-alignwidth to
modify alignment length. Output order may vary when using multiple
threads.
.TP
.BI \-\-uchimeout \0filename
Write chimera detection results to \fIfilename\fR using the uchime
tab-separated format of 18 fields (see the list below). Use
\-\-uchimeout5 to use a format compatible with usearch v5 and earlier

Clustering options:
.RS
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR implements a single-pass, greedy star-clustering
algorithm, similar to the algorithms implemented in usearch, DNAclust
and sumaclust for example. Important parameters are the global
clustering threshold (\-\-id) and the pairwise identity definition
(\-\-iddef).
.TP 9
.BI \-\-centroids \0filename
Output cluster centroid sequences to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta
format. The centroid is the sequence that seeded the cluster (i.e. the
first sequence of the cluster).
.TP
.BI \-\-clusterout_id
Add cluster identifier information to the output files
when using the \-\-consout and \-\-profile options.
.TP
.BI \-\-clusterout_sort
Sort output files by decreasing abundance
when using the \-\-consout, \-\-msaout and \-\-profile options.

perform a sorting by decreasing sequence abundance beforehand.
.TP
.BI \-\-cluster_smallmem \0filename

modifying their order beforehand. Sequence are expected to be sorted
by decreasing sequence length, unless \-\-usersort is used.
.TP
.BI \-\-clusters \0string
Output each cluster to a separate fasta file using the prefix
\fIstring\fR and a ticker (0, 1, 2, etc.) to construct the path and
filenames.
.TP
.BI \-\-consout \0filename
Output cluster consensus sequences to \fIfilename\fR. For each
cluster, a multiple alignment is computed, and a consensus sequence is
constructed by taking the majority symbol (nucleotide or gap) from
each column of the alignment. Columns containing a majority of gaps
are skipped, except for terminal gaps.
.TP

.TP
.BI \-\-id \0real
Do not add the target to the cluster if the pairwise identity with the
centroid is lower than \fIreal\fR (value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0
included). The pairwise identity is defined as the number of (matching

.TP
.BI \-\-msaout \0filename
Output a multiple sequence alignment and a consensus sequence for each
cluster to \fIfilename\fR, in fasta format. The consensus sequence is
constructed by taking the majority symbol (nucleotide or gap) from
each column of the alignment. Columns containing a majority of gaps
are skipped, except for terminal gaps.
.TP
.BI \-\-profile \0filename
Output a sequence profile to a text file with the frequency of each
nucleotide in each position in the multiple alignment for each
cluster. There is a FASTA-like header line for each cluster, followed
by the profile information in a tab-separated format. The columns are:
position (1-based), consensus nucleotide, number of A's, number of
C's, number of G's, number of Ts or Us, and finally the number of
gaps. If ambiguous nucleotide symbols are present, the numbers may be
floating point numbers, otherwise they are integers. For instance,
an 'R' will count 0.5 towards an A and 0.5 towards a G.
.TP
.BI \-\-qmask\~ "none|dust|soft"
Mask simple repeats and low-complexity regions in sequences using the
\fIdust\fR or the \fIsoft\fR algorithms, or do not mask
(\fInone\fR). Warning, when using \fIsoft\fR masking, clustering
becomes case sensitive. The default is to mask using \fIdust\fR.

headers).
.TP
.B \-\-sizeorder
When an amplicon is close to 2 or more centroids, both within the
distance specified with the \-\-id option, resolve the ambiguity by
clustering it with the centroid having the highest abundance, not
necessarily the closest one. The option only has effect when the value
specified with \-\-maxaccepts is higher than one. The \-\-sizeorder
option turns on what is sometimes referred to as abundance-based
greedy clustering (AGC), in contrast to the default distance-based
greedy clustering (DGC).
.TP
.B \-\-sizeout
Add abundance annotations to the output fasta files (add the pattern
";size=\fIinteger\fR;" to sequence headers). If \-\-sizein is
specified, abundance annotations are reported to output files, and
each cluster centroid receives a new abundance value corresponding to
the total abundance of the amplicons included in the cluster
(\-\-centroids option). If \-\-sizein is not specified, input
abundances are set to 1 for amplicons, and to the number of amplicons
per cluster for centroids.

are considered the same).
.TP
.BI \-\-derep_prefix \0filename
Merge sequences with identical prefixes contained in \fIfilename\fR.
A short sequence identical to an initial segment (prefix) of another
sequence is considered a replicate of the longer sequence. If a
sequence is identical to the prefix of two or more longer sequences
it is undefined which of the longer sequences it will be considered
a replicate of. This has consequences regarding the total abundance
reported with \-\-sizeout. When considering whether two sequence

FASTA/FASTQ file processing options:
.RS
.PP
Analyse, shorten, filter, convert or merge sequences in FASTQ files,
or reverse complement sequences in FASTA or FASTQ files. The
\-\-fastq_chars command can be used to analyse FASTQ files to identify
the type of FASTQ file and the range of quality score values used. To
convert between different FASTQ file variants, use the
\-\-fastq_convert command. A statistical analysis of the quality and
length of the sequences in a FASTQ file is performed with the
\-\-fastq_stats command. Sequences may be shortened, filtered and
converted by the \-\-fastq_filter command. Paired-end reads can be
merged using the \-\-fastq_mergepairs command. Finally, the
\-\-fastx_revcomp command will reverse complement sequences.
.PP
.TP 9
.B \-\-eeout
When writing FASTQ file output, include the number of expected errors
in the sequence header. Used with \-\-fastq_filter.
.TP
.BI \-\-eetabbedout \0filename
When specified with the \-\-fastq_mergepairs command, write statistics
with expected errors of each merged read to the given file. The file
is a tab separated file with four columns: The number of errors
expected in the forward read, the number of expected errors in the
reverse read, the number of observed errors in the forward read, and
the number of observed errors in the reverse read. The observed number
of errors are the number of differences in the overlap region of the
merged sequence relative to each of the reads in the pair.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastaout \0filename
Write to the given FASTA-formatted file the sequences that passes the
filter of the \-\-fastq_filter command, or the merged sequences from
the \-\-fastq_mergepairs command.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastaout_notmerged_fwd \0filename
For \-\-fastq_mergepairs, write forward reads not merged to the
specified FASTA file.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastaout_notmerged_rev \0filename
For \-\-fastq_mergepairs, write reverse reads not merged to the
specified FASTA file.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastaout_discarded \0filename
Write sequences that does not pass the filter of the \-\-fastq_filter
command to the given FASTA-formatted file.
.TP
.B \-\-fastq_allowmergestagger
Allow the \-\-fastq_mergepairs command to merge staggered read
pairs. Staggered pairs are pairs where the 3' end of the reverse read
has an overhang to the left of the 5' end of the forward read. This
situation can occur when a very short fragment is sequenced. The 3'
overhang of the reverse read is not included in the merged
sequence. The opposite option is the \-\-fastq_nostagger option. The
default is to discard staggered pairs.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_ascii\~ "positive integer"
The ASCII character number used as the basis for the FASTQ quality
score. The default is 33, which is used by the Sanger / Illumina 1.8+
FASTQ format (phred+33). The value 64 is used by the Solexa, Illumina
1.3+ and Illumina 1.5+ format (phred+64).
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_asciiout\~ "positive integer"
The ASCII character number used as the basis for the FASTQ quality
score when writing FASTQ output files. The default is 33. Applies only
to \-\-fastq_convert.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_chars \0filename
Try to automatically detect the type of FASTQ file given (Solexa,
Illumina 1.3+, Illumina 1.5+ or Illumina 1.8+/Sanger) by analysing the
range of quality score values used.  Summarize the composition of
sequence and quality strings contained in the input FASTQ file. For
each of the four DNA letters, \-\-fastq_chars gives the number of
occurrences of the letter, its relative frequency and the length of
the longest run of that letter. For each character present in the
quality strings, \-\-fastq_chars gives the ASCII value of the
character, its relative frequency, and the number of times a k-mer of
that character appears at the end of quality strings. The length of
the k-mer can be set using \-\-fastq_tail (4 by default). The command
will suggest values for the \-\-fastq_ascii, \-\-fastq_qmin and
\-\-fastq_qmax options to be used with the other commands that require
a FASTQ input file.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_convert \0filename
Convert between the different variants of the FASTQ file format. The
type of input file must be specified with the \-\-fastq_ascii option
(either 33 or 64, the default is 33), and the type of output file must
be specified with the \-\-fastq_asciiout option (default 33). The
mimimum and maximum output quality scores may be limited using the
\-\-fastq_qminout and \-\-fastq_qmaxout options. The output file is
specified with the \-\-fastqout option.
.TP
.B \-\-fastq_eeout
When writing FASTQ file output, include the number of expected errors
in the sequence header. Used with \-\-fastq_mergepairs.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_filter \0filename
Shorten and/or filter the sequences in the given FASTQ file and output
the remaining sequences to the FASTQ file specified with the
\-\-fastqout option and, after conversion, to the FASTA file specified
with the \-\-fastaout option. The discarded sequences will be written
to the files specified with the \-\-fastaout_discarded and
\-\-fastqout_discarded options. Sequences may be shortened using the
options \-\-fastq_stripleft, \-\-fastq_trunclen, and
\-\-fastq_truncqual. The sequences may be filtered using the options
\-\-fastq_maxee, \-\-fastq_maxee_rate, \-\-fastq_maxns,
\-\-fastq_minlen and \-\-fastq_trunclen. If shortening results in an
empty sequence, it will be discarded. The sequences are first
shortened and then filtered based on the remaining bases. If no
shortening or filtering options are givem, all sequences will be
written to the output files, possibly after conversion from FASTQ to
FASTA format. The \-\-relabel option may be used to relabel the output
sequences. The \-\-eeout may be used to output the expected number of
errors in each sequence.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_maxdiffs\~ "positive integer"
Specify the maximum number of non-matching nucleotides allowed in the
overlap region with the \-\-fastq_mergepairs command. By default there
is no limit.

sequences with more than the specified number of N's.
.TP
.BI \-\-fastq_mergepairs\0 filename
Merge paired-end sequence reads into one sequence using a method
similar to the PEAR algorithm (Zhang, Kobert, Flouri & Stamatakis,
2014), except that base frequencies are not empirically estimated. The
algorithm employs a statistical test to identify merged reads that
have a significantly good alignment score. The forward reads are
specified as the argument to this option and the reverse reads are
specified with the \-\-reverse option. The merged sequences are output
to the file(s) specified with the \-\-fastaout or \-\-fastqout
options. The non-merged reads can be output to the files specified
with the \-\-fastaout_notmerged_fwd, \-\-fastaout_notmerged_rev,
\-\-fastqout_notmerged_fwd and \-\-fastqout_notmerged_rev
options. Statistics may be output to the file specified with the
\-\-eetabbedout option. Sequences will be truncated as specified with
the \-\-fastq_truncqual option to remove low-quality bases in the 3'
end. Sequences shorter than specified with \-\-fastq_minlen (after
truncation) will be discarded (1 by default). Sequences with too many
ambiguous bases (N's), as specified with the \-\-fastq_maxns will also
be discarded (no limit by default). Staggered reads will not be merged
unless the \-\-fastq_allowmergestagger option is specified. The
minimum length of the overlap region between the reads may be specfied
with the \-\-minovlen option (default 1), and the overlap region may
not include more mismatches than specified with the \-\-maxdiffs
option (no limit by default), otherwise the read pair will be
discarded. The mimimum and maximum length of the merged sequence may
be specified with the \-\-fastq_minmergelen and \-\-fastq_maxmergelen
options, respectively. Other relevant options are: \-\-fastq_ascii,
\-\-fastq_maxee, \-\-fastq_nostagger, \-\-fastq_qmax, \-\-fastq_qmin,
and \-\-label_suffix.

.BI \-\-gapext \0string
Set penalties for a gap extension. See \-\-gapopen for a complete
description of the penalty declaration system. The default is to
initialize the six gap extending penalties using a penalty of 2 for
extending internal gaps and a penalty of 1 for extending terminal
gaps, in both query and target sequences (i.e. 2I/1E).
.TP
.BI \-\-gapopen \0string
Set penalties for a gap opening. A gap opening can occur in six
different contexts: in the query (Q) or in the target (T) sequence, at
the left (L) or right (R) extremity of the sequence, or inside the
sequence (I). Sequence symbols (Q and T) can be combined with location
symbols (L, I, and R), and numerical values to declare penalties for
all possible contexts: aQL/bQI/cQR/dTL/eTI/fTR, where abcdef are zero
or positive integers, and "/" is used as a separator.
.br
To simplify declarations, the location symbols (L, I, and R) can be
combined, the symbol (E) can be used to treat both extremities (L and
R) equally, and the symbols Q and T can be omitted to treat query and
target sequences equally. For instance, the default is to declare a
penalty of 20 for opening internal gaps and a penalty of 2 for opening
terminal gaps (left or right), in both query and target sequences
(i.e. 20I/2E). If only a numerical value is given, without any
sequence or location symbol, then the penalty applies to all gap
openings. To forbid gap-opening, an infinite penalty value can be
declared with the symbol "*". To use \fBvsearch\fR as a semi-global
aligner, a null-penalty can be applied to the left (L) or right (R)
gaps.
.br
\fBvsearch\fR always initializes the six gap opening
penalties using the default parameters (20I/2E). The user is then free
to declare only the values he/she wants to modify. The \fIstring\fR is
scanned from left to right, accepted symbols are (0123456789/LIREQT*),
and later values override previous values.
.br
Please note that \fBvsearch\fR, in contrast to usearch, only allows
integer gap penalties. Because the lowest gap penalties are 0.5 by
default in usearch, all default scores and gap penalties in
\fBvsearch\fR have been doubled to maintain equivalent penalties and
to produce identical alignments.

Masking section.
.TP
.BI \-\-id \0real
Reject the sequence match if the pairwise identity is lower than
\fIreal\fR (value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 included). The search
process sorts target sequences by decreasing number of \fIk\fR-mers
they have in common with the query sequence, using that information as
a proxy for sequence similarity. That efficient pre-filtering will
also prevent pairwise alignments with weakly matching targets, as
there needs to be at least 6 shared \fIk\fR-mers to start the pairwise
alignment, and at least one out of every 16 \fIk\fR-mers from the
query needs to match the target. Consequently, using values lower than
\-\-id 0.5 is not likely to capture more weakly matching targets. The
pairwise identity is by default defined as the number of (matching
columns) / (alignment length - terminal gaps). That definition can be
modified by \-\-iddef.

Score assigned to a match (i.e. identical nucleotides) in the pairwise
alignment. The default value is 2.
.TP
.BI \-\-matched \0filename
Write query sequences matching database target sequences to
\fIfilename\fR, in fasta format.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxaccepts\~ "positive integer"
Maximum number of hits to accept before stopping the search. The
default value is 1. This option works in pair with \-\-maxrejects. The
search process sorts target sequences by decreasing number of
\fIk\fR-mers they have in common with the query sequence, using that
information as a proxy for sequence similarity. After pairwise
alignments, if the first target sequence passes the acceptation
criteria, it is accepted as best hit and the search process stops for
that query. If \-\-maxaccepts is set to a higher value, more hits are
accepted. If \-\-maxaccepts and \-\-maxrejects are both set to 0, the
complete database is searched.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxdiffs\~ "positive integer"
Reject the sequence match if the alignment contains at least
\fIinteger\fR substitutions, insertions or deletions.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxgaps\~ "positive integer"
Reject the sequence match if the alignment contains at least
\fIinteger\fR insertions or deletions.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxhits\~ "positive integer"
Maximum number of hits to show once the search is terminated (hits are
sorted by decreasing identity). Unlimited by default. That option
applies to \-\-alnout, \-\-blast6out, \-\-fastapairs, \-\-samout,
\-\-uc, or \-\-userout output files.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxid \0real
Reject the sequence match if the percentage of identity between the
two sequences is greater than \fIreal\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxqsize\~ "positive integer"
Reject query sequences with an abundance greater than \fIinteger\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxqt \0real
Reject if the query/target sequence length ratio is greater than
\fIreal\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxrejects\~ "positive integer"
Maximum number of non-matching target sequences to consider before
stopping the search. The default value is 32. This option works in
pair with \-\-maxaccepts. The search process sorts target sequences by
decreasing number of \fIk\fR-mers they have in common with the query
sequence, using that information as a proxy for sequence
similarity. After pairwise alignments, if none of the first 32
examined target sequences pass the acceptation criteria, the search
process stops for that query (no hit). If \-\-maxrejects is set to a
higher value, more target sequences are considered. If \-\-maxaccepts
and \-\-maxrejects are both set to 0, the complete database is
searched.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxsizeratio \0real
Reject if the query/target abundance ratio is greater than
\fIreal\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-maxsl \0real

Reject if the shorter/longer sequence length ratio is lower than
\fIreal\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-mintsize\~ "positive integer"
Reject target sequences with an abundance lower than \fIinteger\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-minwordmatches\~ "non-negative integer"
Minimum number of word matches required for a sequence to be
considered further. Default value is 10 for the default word length
8. For word lengths 7-15, the default minimum word matches is 14, 10,
9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2, respectively. If the query sequence has fewer
unique words than the number specified, all words must match.
.TP
.BI \-\-mismatch\~ "integer"
Score assigned to a mismatch (i.e. different nucleotides) in the
pairwise alignment. The default value is -4.
.TP
.BI \-\-notmatched \0filename
Write query sequences not matching database target sequences to
\fIfilename\fR, in fasta format.
.TP
.B \-\-output_no_hits
Write both matching and non-matching queries to \-\-alnout,
\-\-blast6out, \-\-samout or \-\-userout output files (\-\-uc and
\-\-uc_allhits output files always feature non-matching
queries). Non-matching queries are labelled "No hits" in \-\-alnout
files.
.TP
.B \-\-pattern \fIstring\fR
This option is ignored. It is provided for compatibility with usearch.
.TP
.BI \-\-qmask\~ "none|dust|soft"
Mask simple repeats and low-complexity regions in query sequences
using the \fIdust\fR or the \fIsoft\fR algorithms, or do not mask
(\fInone\fR). Warning, when using \fIsoft\fR masking search commands
become case sensitive. The default is to mask using \fIdust\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-query_cov \0real
Reject if the fraction of the query aligned to the target sequence is
lower than \fIreal\fR. The query coverage is computed as
(matches + mismatches) / query sequence length. Internal or terminal
gaps are not taken into account.
.TP
.B \-\-rightjust
Reject the sequence match if the pairwise alignment ends with gaps.
.TP
.BI \-\-rowlen\~ "positive integer"
Width of alignment lines in \-\-alnout output. The default value is
64. Set to 0 to eliminate wrapping.
.TP
.B \-\-samheader
Include header lines to the sam file when \-\-samout is specified. The
header will include @HD, @SQ and @PG lines, but no read group (@RG)
information. By default no header lines are written.
.TP
.BI \-\-samout \0filename
Write alignment results to \fIfilename\fR in the SAM format. For a
description of the format, see
<https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs>. Output order may vary when
using multiple threads.
.TP
.BI \-\-search_exact \0filename
Search for exact full-length matches to the query sequences contained
in \fIfilename\fR in the database of target sequences (\-\-db). Only
100% exact matches are reported and this command is much faster than
\-\-usearch_global. The \-\-id, \-\-maxaccepts and \-\-maxrejects
options are ignored, but the rest of the searching options may be
specified.
.TP
.B \-\-self
Reject the sequence match if the query and target labels are
identical.
.TP
.B \-\-selfid
Reject the sequence match if the query and target sequences are
strictly identical.
.TP
.B \-\-sizeout
Add abundance annotations to the output of the option \-\-dbmatched
(using the pattern ";size=\fIinteger\fR;"), to report the number of
queries that matched each target.
.TP
.BI \-\-strand\~ "plus|both"
When searching for similar sequences, check the \fIplus\fR strand only
(default) or check \fIboth\fR strands.
.TP
.BI \-\-target_cov \0real
Reject the sequence match if the fraction of the target sequence
aligned to the query sequence is lower than \fIreal\fR. The target
coverage is computed as (matches + mismatches) / target sequence
length.  Internal or terminal gaps are not taken into account.
.TP
.B \-\-top_hits_only
Output only the hits with the highest percentage of identity with the
query.

output file. Fields are separated by "+" (e.g. query+target+id). See
the "Userfields" section for a complete list of fields.
.TP
.BI \-\-userout \0filename
Write user-defined tab-separated output to \fIfilename\fR. Select the
fields with the option \-\-userfields. Output order may vary when
using multiple threads. If \-\-userfields is empty or not present,
\fIfilename\fR is empty.
.TP
.BI \-\-weak_id \0real
Show hits with percentage of identity of at least \fIreal\fR, without
terminating the search. A normal search stops as soon as enough hits
are found (as defined by \-\-maxaccepts, \-\-maxrejects, and
\-\-id). As \-\-weak_id reports weak hits that are not deduced from
\-\-maxaccepts, high \-\-id values can be used, hence preserving both
speed and sensitivity. Logically, \fIreal\fR must be smaller than the
value indicated by \-\-id.
.TP
.BI \-\-wordlength\~ "positive integer"
Length of words (i.e. \fIk\fR-mers) for database indexing. The range
of possible values goes from 7 to 15, but values near 8 or 9 are
generally recommended. Longer words may reduce the sensitivity/recall
for weak similarities, but can increase precision. On the other hand,
shorter words may increase sensitivity or recall, but may reduce
precision. Computation time will generally increase with shorter words
and decrease with longer words, but will increase again for very long
words. Memory requirements for a part of the index increase with a
factor of 4 each time word length increases by one nucleotide, and
this generally becomes significant for long words (12 or more). The
default value is 8.

.SH DELIBERATE CHANGES
If you are a usearch user, our objective is to make you feel at
home. That's why \fBvsearch\fR was designed to behave like usearch, to
some extent. Like any complex software, usearch is not free from
quirks and inconsistencies. We decided not to reproduce some of them,
and for complete transparency, to document here the deliberate changes
we made.
.PP
During a search with usearch, when using the options \-\-blast6out and
\-\-output_no_hits, for queries with no match the number of fields
reported is 13, where it should be 12. This is corrected in
\fBvsearch\fR.
.PP
The field raw of the \-\-userfields option is not informative in
usearch. This is corrected in \fBvsearch\fR.
.PP
The fields qlo, qhi, tlo, thi now have counterparts (qilo, qihi, tilo,
tihi) reporting alignment coordinates ignoring terminal gaps.
.PP
In usearch, when using the option \-\-output_no_hits, queries that
receive no match are reported in blast6out file, but not in the
alignment output file. This is corrected in \fBvsearch\fR.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR introduces a new \-\-cluster_size command that sorts
sequences by decreasing abundance before clustering.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR reintroduces \-\-iddef alternative pairwise identity
definitions that were removed from usearch.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR extends the \-\-topn option to sorting commands.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR extends the \-\-sizein option to dereplication
(\-\-derep_fulllength) and clustering (\-\-cluster_fast).
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR treats T and U as identical nucleotides during
dereplication.
.PP
\fBvsearch\fR sorting is stabilized by using sequence abundances or
sequences labels as secondary or tertiary keys.

.BR v1.4.2\~ "released October 2nd, 2015"
Dynamic loading of libraries for reading gzip and bzip2 compressed
files if available. Circumvention of missing gzoffset function in
zlib 1.2.3 and earlier.
.TP
.BR v1.4.3\~ "released October 3rd, 2015"
Fix a bug with determining amount of memory on some versions of Apple
OS X.
.TP
.BR v1.4.4\~ "released October 3rd, 2015"
Remove debug message.
.TP
.BR v1.4.5\~ "released October 6rd, 2015"
Fix memory allocation bug when reading long FASTA sequences.
.TP
.BR v1.4.6\~ "released October 6rd, 2015"
Fix subtle bug in SIMD alignment code that reduced accuracy.
.TP
.BR v1.4.7\~ "released October 7th, 2015"
Fixes a problem with searching for or clustering sequences with
repeats. In this new version, vsearch will look at all words occurring
at least once in the sequences in the initial step. Previously only
words occurring exactly once were considered. In addition, vsearch now
requires at least 10 words to be shared by the sequences, previously
only 6 were required. If the query contains less than 10 words, all
words must be present for a match. This change seems to lead to
slightly reduced recall, but somewhat increased precision, ending up
with slightly improved overall accuracy.
.TP
.BR v1.5.0\~ "released October 7th, 2015"
This version introduces the new option \-\-minwordmatches that allows
the user to specify the minimum number of matching unique words before
a sequence is considered further. New default values for different
word lengths are also set. The minimum word length is increased to 7.
.TP
.BR v1.6.0\~ "released October 9th, 2015"
This version adds the relabeling options (\-\-relabel, \-\-relabel_md5
and \-\-relabel_sha1) to the shuffle command. It also adds the
\-\-xsize option to the clustering, dereplication, shuffling and sorting
commands.
.TP
.BR v1.6.1\~ "released October 14th, 2015"
Fix bugs and update manual and help text regarding relabelling. Add
all relabelling options to the subsampling command. Add the \-\-xsize
option to chimera detection, dereplication and fastq filtering
commands. Refactoring of code.
.TP
.BR v1.7.0\~ "released October 14th, 2015"
Add \-\-relabel_keep option.
.TP
.BR v1.8.0\~ "released October 19th, 2015"
Added \-\-search_exact, \-\-fastx_mask and \-\-fastq_convert commands.
Changed most commands to read FASTQ input files as well as FASTA files.
Modified \-\-fastx_revcomp and \-\-fastx_subsample to write FASTQ files.
.TP
.BR v1.8.1\~ "released November 2nd, 2015"
Fixes for compatibility with QIIME and older OS X versions.
.TP
.BR v1.9.0\~ "released November 12th, 2015"
Added the \-\-fastq_mergepairs command and associated options. This
command has not been tested well yet. Included additional files to
avoid dependency of autoconf for compilation. Fixed an error where
identifiers in fasta headers where not truncated at tabs, just spaces.
Fixed a bug in detection of the file format (FASTA/FASTQ) of a gzip
compressed input file.
.TP
.BR v1.9.1\~ "released November 13th, 2015"
Fixed memory leak and a bug in score computation in fastq_mergepairs,
and improved speed.
.TP
.BR v1.9.2\~ "released November 17th, 2015"
Fixed a bug in the computation of some values with \-\-fastq_stats.
