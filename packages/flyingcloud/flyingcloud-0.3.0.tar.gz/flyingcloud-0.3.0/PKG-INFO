        ===================================
        Build Docker images using SaltStack
        ===================================
        
        This is a Python library and set of tools that lets you build `Docker <http://docker.com>`_ images using 
        masterless `SaltStack <http://saltstack.com/>`_ instead of (or in addition to) using Dockerfiles.
        
        FlyingCloud is easy to run from the commandline, and built to be run on
        a Continuous Integration server.
        
        ============================
        Why would I want to do that?
        ============================
        
        * Because you are installing a complex stack of software and have outgrown Docker's simple installation system.
        * Because you want to configure your Docker layers instead of writing shell scripts.
        * Because you want to install the same software stack on developer workstations and don't want to
          maintain two separate ways of installing a complex stack of software.
        
        ============
        How it works
        ============
        
        FlyingCloud runs `Salt <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/>`_
        in `masterless mode <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/quickstart.html>`_,
        applying `Salt states <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html>`_
        for each Docker layer. Layers can also run custom Python code if necessary.
        
        Salt states can do many system administration tasks solely with configuration.
        `Here's a list of all the built-in Salt states <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/ref/states/all/index.html>`_.
        And you can `write your own <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/writing.html>`_.
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install flyingcloud
