**Sequana** includes a set of pipelines related to NGS (new generation sequencing). 

It will provide a set of modular pipelines and reports associated to them.


Installation
=================


::

    pip install sequana


Some dependencies required include matplotlib, pandas, cutadapt, pysam. If you
are new or starting with Python, we strongly recommand to use anaconda and to
install those dependencies::

    conda install matplotlib pandas cutadapt pysam

although the code is Python2.7 and Python3.5 compatible, a dependency
(Snakemake) only supports Python3.5 for the moment so, we will assume you have a
Python3.5 version installed.


Example
==========

**WIP** but one component will be to have a set of rules available and ready to use in Snakefiles
::

    # contaminant and adapter removal search
    from sequana import snakemake
    snakemake.rules()

In a snakefile::

    from sequana import snakemake as sm
    include: sm.rules['dag']
