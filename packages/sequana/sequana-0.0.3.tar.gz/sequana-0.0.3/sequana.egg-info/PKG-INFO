        **Sequana** includes a set of pipelines related to NGS (new generation sequencing). 
        
        It will provide a set of modular pipelines and reports associated to them.
        
        
        Installation
        =================
        
        
        ::
        
            pip install sequana
        
        
        Some dependencies required include matplotlib, pandas, cutadapt, pysam. If you
        are new or starting with Python, we strongly recommand to use anaconda and to
        install those dependencies::
        
            conda install matplotlib pandas cutadapt pysam
        
        although the code is Python2.7 and Python3.5 compatible, a dependency
        (Snakemake) only supports Python3.5 for the moment so, we will assume you have a
        Python3.5 version installed.
        
        
        Example
        ==========
        
        ::
        
            # contaminant and adapter removal search
            from sequana import biomics
        
        
            pipeline = biomics.Biomics("*fastq.gz") # assumm two paired-end fastq files
            pipeline.create()
            pipeline.start()
            pipeline.report()
        
        Behind the scene, a Snakefile and a config file are created in the local
        directory. The snakefile can be executed indepedently::
        
            snakemake Snakefile -p
