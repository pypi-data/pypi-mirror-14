        Configuration files with a Python-like syntax
        ---------------------------------------------
        
        Parse a very Python-like mini-language to produce a dictionary.  This
        allows Python programs to be configured using a Python-like language
        consisting of dictionaries, tuples, and literal values.  Plasmic
        dictionary keys must be literal values.  Plasmic dictionary values can
        be literal values and, possibly nested, tuples and other plasmic
        dictionaries.
        
        Here is a sample configuration::
        
          {section1:
            {key1: "value1",
             key2: 2},
           section2:
            {key1: "othervalue",
             key3: 3.0
             subsection1:
              {key4: (1, 2, 3)
               key5: {"foo": "meta",
                      "bar": "syntactic"}
              }
            }
          }
        
        As a convenience all dictionary entries keyed by symbols have their
        keys converted to the lower case string equivalent.
        
        The plasmic Python-like language contains almost no expression
        evaluation.  The single, optional, expression allowed is a
        ``string.Formmatter.format()`` formatting syntax used for
        interpolation -- the insertion of of data into values by reference to
        Plasmic dictionary keys.
        
        The recommended suffix for files written in the Plasmic language is:
        ``.pcf``
        
        
        Sub-Projects
        ------------
        
        Plasmic has the following sub-projects to support configuring
        applications using files written in Plasmic.  Most users will not want
        to use plasmic directly but will import one of these sub-projects.
        
        
        plasmic.configparser
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        A ``configparser``-like API for the reading and writing of
        configuration files in plasmic syntax.
        
        ::
        
           import plasmic.configparser
        
        
        plasmic.montague
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        A plugin allowing Plasmic configuration files to drive the
        ``Montague`` WSGI component loader.
