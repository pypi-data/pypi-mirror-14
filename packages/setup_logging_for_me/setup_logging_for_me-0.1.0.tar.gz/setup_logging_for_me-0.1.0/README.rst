setup logging for me
===============================

I never remember how to do python logging basic config. Do you?

Need to view your logs on the console? Just do:

.. code-block:: python

    import setup_logging_for_me
    ...
    setup_logging_for_me.basicConfig()

Which does nothing more than calling to:

.. code-block:: python

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                        format="%(name)s %(levelname)s %(asctime)s - %(message)s)
