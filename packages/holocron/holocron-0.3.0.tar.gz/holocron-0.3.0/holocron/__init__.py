    Holocron is an extendable static blog generator powered by the Force.

    Like others, it reads text files in various formats, renders them using
    templates and produces a ready-to-publish static website which could be
    served by Nginx or another web server.

    Unlike others, it tries to retrieve as many information as possible from
    the file system. Its core follows the KISS principle and doesn't reinvent
    the wheel.
