        GFlow
        ========================
        
        This is a command line interface application that allows datasets and a workflow to be specified in a config file and then have the workflow executed on an instance of Galaxy.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From the source directory:
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ python setup.py install 
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Make a copy of the sample config file in ``config/`` and set the parameters in it as desired:
        
            $ cp config/config.yml.sample config/config.yml
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Then, execute:
        
            $ gflow config/config.yml
        
        Or, if executing from the source directory without having installed the tool:
        
            $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
            $ ./scripts/gflow config/config.yml
            
        Tests
        -----
        
        A small number of data files and workflow files have been included in ``data/`` and ``workflow/`` for testing purposes.
        After setting the ```GALAXY_URL``` and ```GALAXY_API_KEY``` environment variables, execute the tests with:
        
            $ python setup.py test
