Description: Lingotek Translation Utility
        ============================
        
        The Lingotek Translation Utility (``ltk``) connects your content from
        the command line to the Translation Network™. It provides yet another
        way for continuously globalizing all of your translatable content.
        
        The Lingotek Translation Utility allows you to quickly add content,
        request translations, and pull translations from the Lingotek Cloud.
        
        Content can be sent up in any a variety of formats including: ``csv``,
        ``dita``, ``ditamap``, ``docx``, ``doxygen``, ``dtd``, ``excel``,
        ``html``, ``idml``, ``java_properties``, ``json``, ``odp``, ``ods``,
        ``odt``, ``pdf``, ``plaintext``, ``po``, ``pptx``, ``ppt``,
        ``rails_yaml``, ``resx``, ``rtf``, ``subtitle_rip``, ``table``, ``ts``,
        ``xliff``, and ``xml``.
        
        Developers love how easily it can be used to interact with the
        Translation Network™. Using the ``-v`` and ``-vv`` switches shows
        exactly which API calls are being used to help developers code custom
        connectors.
