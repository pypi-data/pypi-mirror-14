tmux2html
=========

tmux2html captures full tmux windows or individual panes then parses
their contents into HTML in living |color|. The output can either be
still snapshots, or animated sequences.

With a web server that uses gzip compression, the size over the network
is negligible for reasonably sized windows or panes.

Examples
--------

Some of these may be large in dimensions. You'll need to zoom out if you
want to see all panes at once. These are not raster graphics!

-  Single Pane ``[disk: 124KB, gzip: 13KB]``:

-  Full Window (Big) ``[disk: 237KB, gzip: 21KB]``:

-  Animated ``[disk: 204KB, gzip: 146KB]``:

-  Partially Animated (Big) ``[disk: 122KB, gzip: 89KB]``:
   https://share.esdf.io/UNoltIEHt4/partial-animated.html (Only some
   panes are animating)
-  Scrollable pane history ``[disk: 83KB, gzip: 47KB]``:
   https://share.esdf.io/sEDNecDCat/scroll.html (Scroll with the mouse
   wheel, or two fingers on a touch screen.)
-  Complete pane history ``[disk: 63KB, gzip: 18KB]``:
   https://share.esdf.io/bvn100jhi7/history.html
-  Over kill animation ``[disk: 679KB, gzip: 516KB]``:
   https://share.esdf.io/eSZQheewUL/absurd-animation.html (This
   animation is recorded using a 10ms interval. It will not be great on
   mobile devices.)
-  "Streaming": https://share.esdf.io/log.html (This displays the HTTP
   log for the links above.)

If you decide to look at the telnet animations yourself and don't know
how to exit, use ``Ctrl-]`` then type ``quit``. For the Star Wars
animation, press ``Ctrl-]<enter>`` to get the prompt.

Rationale
---------

This was a weekend project I made for fun and I have no particular use
for it beyond annoying my friends about how bad they should feel for not
using tmux. I also thought it would be neat to have a render of my
sessions that didn't result in an image using some crummy font on a
headless server.

I suppose you can use cron to capture screens and display it on your
website, or use it to create terminal snippets for your blog. You could
also load a pane render in elinks within your coworker's session. The
only limit is your imagination, my friend. :sparkles:

    9:39:46 PM Jef Myers: what the fuck is tmux?

— Jef Myers

Requirements
------------

-  tmux 1.8
-  Python 2.7 or 3.4 (could be wrong since it's not tested in lower
   versions)

Installation
------------

.. code:: shell

    pip install tmux2html

Usage
-----

.. code:: shell

    tmux2html 4 -o window_5_in_current_session.html
    tmux2html .0 -o first_pane_in_current_window.html
    tmux2html other:1.2 -o second_window_third_pane_in_other_session.html

Command Line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``target`` (positional) - Target window or pane. Uses tmux's target
   syntax, but always 0-indexed. (e.g. ``sess:1.2`` - Session - sess,
   Window 2, Pane 3. Default target is window.)
-  ``-o``, ``--output`` - Output file. Prints to stdout if omitted.
-  ``-m``, ``--mode`` - Output file permissions. Default - 644
-  ``--light`` - Light background.
-  ``--interval`` - Number of seconds between captures.
-  ``--duration`` - Number of seconds to capture. 0 for indefinite
   recording, -1 to disable.
-  ``--stream`` - Continuously renders until stopped and adds a script
   to auto refresh based on ``--interval``. See the notes below for more
   info.
-  ``--fg`` - Foreground color. Can be a color index or R,G,B
-  ``--bg`` - Background color. Can be a color index or R,G,B
-  ``--full`` - Renders the full history of a single pane
-  ``--history`` - Specifies the maximum number of pane history lines to
   include (implies ``--full``)

Limitations
-----------

-  The cursor is not displayed.
-  Basic colors will not match your terminal's configured colors.
-  Animations aren't perfect with a lot of splits and fast resizing.
-  [STRIKEOUT:Animations won't capture scrolling the pane's history
   (selection mode).] Scrolling in the pane's history is now recorded in
   animations.
-  [STRIKEOUT:In animations, a pane is updated with the full pane's
   content.] Only the changed lines are updated on a per-pane basis.
-  Zoomed panes will ruin all the fun.
-  Your imagination :stars:

Notes
-----

-  Still captures are plain HTML and CSS.
-  Animations use Javascript.
-  To keep the size reasonable with animations,
   `pako <https://github.com/nodeca/pako>`__ is used to inflate the
   gzipped frame contents. Combined with decompression of frame content,
   the animations will use a fair amount of CPU. So, you shouldn't run
   animations indefinitely on your low performance or battery operated
   fun machines.
-  ``--stream`` doesn't actually "stream", per se. It keeps writing to
   the same file and adds a script that reloads the contents. This can
   be used to have a live feed of a window or pane. However, it's not
   elegant. If you set the interval to too low, your might
   unintentionally DDoS your own web server. Caveat Emptor.
-  The font stack includes
   `Powerline <https://github.com/powerline/fonts>`__ and
   `Nerd <https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts>`__ fonts because I'm
   pedantic and want to see those fancy glyphs. It falls back to
   ``monospace`` if you don't have any of those fonts installed. The
   caveat: if you have more than one of those fonts installed, the first
   one in the font stack might not be your favorite and you'll be forced
   to set your monitor on fire and buy a new one.

To Do
-----

-  [STRIKEOUT:If there's practical use for animations in the future,
   only lines that are different should be updated to keep the size
   low.]
-  Tell people to follow me on Twitter
   (`@cloudsiphon <https://twitter.com/cloudsiphon>`__) if they would
   like to stay up to date on tmux2html, but don't be pushy about it.
