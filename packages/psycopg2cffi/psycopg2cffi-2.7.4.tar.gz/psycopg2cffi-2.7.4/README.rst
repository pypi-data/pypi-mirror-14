An implementation of the psycopg2 module using cffi.
The module is currently compatible with Psycopg 2.5.

You can  install ``psycopg2cffi`` from pypi::

    pip install psycopg2cffi

Or from source::

    python setup.py install

Installation requirements are the same as for ``psycopg2`` - you must
have ``libpq`` headers, ``pg_config`` somewhere on your ``$PATH``,
python development headers (``python-dev`` or similar), and ``ffi-dev``
for ``cffi``.
Installation was tested on Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, CentOS (RHEL 5.0),
OS X 10.8 - 10.10.
It should be possible to make it work on Windows, but I did not test it.

This module works under CPython 2.6+, CPython 3.2+, PyPy 2 and PyPy 3
(PyPy version should be at least 2.0, which is ancient history now).

To use this package with Django or SQLAlchemy invoke a compatability
hook (for example, from ``settings.py`` in case of django, or
from a ``psycopg2.py`` file in site-packages of your virtual env)::

    from psycopg2cffi import compat
    compat.register()

This will map ``psycopg2cffi`` to ``psycopg2``, so now any code that
does ``import psycopg2`` will use ``psycopg2cffi``.

Submit issues to https://github.com/chtd/psycopg2cffi/issues

If you notice that ``psycopg2cffi`` under PyPy is noticably slower than
``psycopg2`` under CPython, submit this to the issues too - it should
not be the case.

This is a port of (Michael van Tellingen port
https://github.com/mvantellingen/psycopg2-ctypes
of Alex Gaynor's rpython port
(https://bitbucket.org/alex_gaynor/pypy-postgresql/overview) of psycopg2 to
python + ctypes) to cffi.

The main motivation for a port was speed - the writeup with benchmarks
is here: http://chtd.ru/blog/bystraya-rabota-s-postgres-pod-pypy/?lang=en

Development
-----------

To run tests, install ``pytest`` and run them with::

    py.test psycopg2cffi

Note that for ``cffi>=1.0`` you need to run ``python setup.py develop``
to rebuild ``_libpq.so`` (if you changed bindings).
And for ``cffi<1.0`` (only PyPy 2.5 and below) you need to run
``python setup.py install`` once to generate ``psycopg2cffi/_config.py``,
otherwise each import will run config and notify tests will fail.

You can also run Django tests. You need to checkout django source, add
psycopg2 compat as described above, and, from the root of the django checkout::

    PYTHONPATH=`pwd` ./tests/runtests.py \
        --settings=psycopg2cffi.tests.psycopg2_tests.testconfig

In case of problems with django tests, see official django docs
