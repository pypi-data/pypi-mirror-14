NOTICE: pandoc-eqnos now supports [tagged equations](#tagged-equations).


pandoc-eqnos 0.9
================

*pandoc-eqnos* is a [pandoc] filter for numbering equations and equation references in markdown documents.

Demonstration: Processing [demo.md] with `pandoc --filter pandoc-eqnos` gives numbered equations and references in [pdf], [tex], [html], [epub], [md] and other formats.

This version of pandoc-eqnos was tested using pandoc 1.17.0.2, 1.16.0.2 and 1.15.2.  It works under linux, Mac OS X and Windows.  Older versions and other platforms can be supported on request.

Installation of the filter is straight-forward.  It is simple to use and has been tested extensively.   I am pleased to receive bug reports and feature requests on the project's [Issues tracker].

Rationale
---------

Equation numbers and references are required for academic writing, but are not currently supported by pandoc.  Pandoc-eqnos is an add-on filter that provides the missing functionality.

The markdown syntax recognized by pandoc-eqnos was developed in [pandoc Issue #813] -- see [this post] by [@scaramouche1].  It seems likely that this will be close to what pandoc ultimately adopts.  Pandoc-eqnos is a transitional package for those who need equation numbers and references now.

Markdown Syntax
---------------

To number an equation, add the label `eq:id` to its attributes:

    $$ y = mx + b $$ {#eq:id}

The prefix `#eq:` is required. `id` should be replaced with a unique identifier composed of letters, numbers, dashes, slashes and underscores.

To reference the equation, use

    @eq:id

or

    {@eq:id}

Curly braces around a reference are stripped from the output.

See [demo.md] for an example.


#### Tagged Equations ####

You may optionally override the equation number by placing a tag in an equation's attributes block as follows:

    $$ y = mx + b $$ {#eq:id tag="B.1"}

The tag may be arbitrary text, or an inline equation such as `$\mathrm{B.1'}$`.  Mixtures of the two are not currently supported.


Usage
-----

To apply the filter, use the following option with pandoc:

    --filter pandoc-eqnos

Note that any use of `--filter pandoc-citeproc` or `--bibliography=FILE` options should come *after* the pandoc-eqnos filter call.


Details
-------

For tex/pdf output, LaTeX's `equation` environment and `\label` and `\ref` macros are used; for all others the numbers are hard-coded.

Similarly, tagged equations make use of LaTeX's' `\tag` macro, whereas hard-coding is used for the rest.

Links are constructed for html and pdf output.


Installation
------------

Pandoc-eqnos requires [python], a programming language that comes pre-installed on linux and Mac OS X, and which is easily installed on Windows.  Either python 2.7 or 3.x will do.

[python]: https://www.python.org/


#### Standard installation ####

Install pandoc-eqnos as root using the shell command

    pip install pandoc-eqnos

To upgrade to the most recent release, use

    pip install --upgrade pandoc-eqnos 

Pip is a script that downloads and installs modules from the Python Package Index, [PyPI].  It should come installed with your python distribution.

If you are prompted to upgrade `pip`, then do so.  Installation errors may occur with older versions.  The command is

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

[PyPI]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi


#### Installing on linux ####

If you are running linux, pip may be packaged separately from python.  On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), you can install pip as root using

    apt-get update
    apt-get install python-pip

During the install you may be asked to run

    easy_install -U setuptools

owing to the ancient version of setuptools that Debian provides.  The command should be executed as root.  You may now follow the [standard installation] procedure given above.

[standard installation]: #standard-installation


#### Installing on Windows ####

It is easy to install python on Windows.  First, [download] the latest release.  Run the installer and complete the following steps:

 1. Install Python pane: Check "Add Python 3.5 to path" then
    click "Customize installation".

 2. Optional Features pane: Click "Next".

 3. Advanced Options pane: Optionally check "Install for all
    users" and customize the install location, then click "Install".

Once python is installed, start the "Command Prompt" program.  Depending on where you installed python, you may need elevate your privileges by right-clicking the "Command Prompt" program and selecting "Run as administrator".  You may now follow the [standard installation] procedure given above.  Be sure to close the Command Prompt program when you have finished.
