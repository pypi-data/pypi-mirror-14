Description: My Test Program
        ---------------
        
        This is a simple test program that I made to learn how to package python
        code for PyPI.  I plan to roughly follow the tutorial at
        http://python-packaging.readthedocs.org/en/latest/metadata.html and play with
        nose and tox for testing, and sphinx for documentation.
