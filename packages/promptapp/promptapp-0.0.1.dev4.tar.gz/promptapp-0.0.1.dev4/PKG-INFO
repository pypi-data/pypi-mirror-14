Description: This is Prompt's CLI.
        
        It has been developed using Python 2.
        
        There are two main folders: classes and tests.
        
        You can run unit and functional testing very easily using the bash script runTests.sh found at the project's root.
        That script also generates a coverage report in html, which will fall in the htmlcov folder, also at the project's root.
        
        ** WARNING **
        You should use the bash script when being placed at the project's root folder in your bash terminal, since there are
        strong dependencies with paths. Correct test running is not guaranteed if this precondition isn't met.
