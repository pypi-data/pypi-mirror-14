Description: Klever KLog
        ===========
        
        While developing a program, have you ever scrolled and scrolled
        through your progam output looking for a trace buried in hundreds of
        lines of log? If so, kleverklog is for you.
        
        Klever KLog uses Apache Kafka to store your program log and provides a
        Kafka client to search, filter and navigate your logs.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. note::
        
           Klever KLog currently only works with twisted logging system but
           expansion is under way.
        
        To use Klever KLog, you need a Kafka server. It is easy to setup. You can run
        one locally, without root privileges. Just follow the `quickstart
        instructions in the Kafka documentation`_.
        
        .. _`quickstart instructions in the Kafka documentation`: http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart
        
        In your program, send your logs to Kafka:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from kleverklog import KafkaLogService
        
            # Somewhere in your program initialization
            KafkaLogService.activate('localhost:9092')
        
        Then, start the log viewer:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           python -m kleverklog
        
        Start your application. The logs should be displayed by Klever KLog,
        colored by log level.
        
        In Klever KLog, you can give the following commands:
        
        `mPATTERN`
          Set the match pattern to PATTERN. New log lines containing PATTERN
          will be highlighted.
        
        `rN`
          Redisplay the last NN log lines, highlighting the ones matching
          the match pattern.
        
        `R`
          Redisplay the whole log, highlighting the lines matching
          the match pattern.
        
        `p`
          Pause the log display.
        
        `P`
          Resume the log display.
        
        `q`
          Quit Klever KLog
