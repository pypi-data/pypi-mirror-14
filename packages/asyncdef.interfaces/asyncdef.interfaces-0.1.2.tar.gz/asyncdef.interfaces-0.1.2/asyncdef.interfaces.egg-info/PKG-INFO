Description: ==========
        interfaces
        ==========
        
        *Public APIs for the core asyncdef components.*
        
        This package contains the public interface definitions for the core asyncdef
        components. This package leverages
        `iface <https://github.com/kevinconway/iface>`_ for the definitions. Items in
        this package are intended to be used with `isinstance` and `issubclass` for
        interface comparisons.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from asyncdef.interfaces.engine import iengine
        
            assert isinstance(some_implementation, iengine.IEngine)
            assert iface.isinstance(some_implementation, iengine.IEngine)
        
        Interface definitions are placed here to prevent the need for importing the
        actual implementation code in order to check the interface.

        ============
        
        Firstly, if you're putting in a patch then thank you! Here are some tips for
        getting your patch merged:
        
        Style
        -----
        
        As long as the code passes the PEP8 and PyFlakes gates then the style is
        acceptable.
        
        Docs
        ----
        
        The PEP257 gate will check that all public methods have docstrings. If you're
        adding something new, like a helper function, try out the
        `napoleon style of docstrings <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-napoleon>`_.
