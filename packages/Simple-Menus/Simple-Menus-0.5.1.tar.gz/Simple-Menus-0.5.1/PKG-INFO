Description: Usually one has to make the user choose an item from a list of items. For this
        one has to write the same code again. The result is usually a very ugly menu
        which is not much user friendly. Simple Menus is a simple library that provides ready made
        classes to make menus which are smart and at the same time good looking and user friendly.
        You say that you can do that with a while loop you say? These menus are error
        tolerant which means that if user enters an input that maps to more than one option,
        it automatically picks those options and shows a new menu with only those options
        to the user. This feature can be turned on and off while making a new menu.
        
        Right now this library provides only the `IdentifierMenu` class to make menus. The
        class accepts many different arguments which can be used to make a wide variety
        of menus. If you are still not satisfied and want more, you can make your own menu classes by
        extending the abstract base class `Menu` which acts the basic structure for all menus in this
        library.
