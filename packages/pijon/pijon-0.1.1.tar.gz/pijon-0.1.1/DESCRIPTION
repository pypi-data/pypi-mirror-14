A lightweight library and tool designed to help migrate schemas and data in a json format:

* python 3.5 library to migrate json schemas
* a tool directly callable to be able to perform the migrations directly

This repository has been done to be able from a schema and data X to perform only the migrations remaining (if some have already been performed) to reach the latest schema and data state.
No fallback capabilities are planned yet
