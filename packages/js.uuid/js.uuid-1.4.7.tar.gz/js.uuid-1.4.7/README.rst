js.uuid
*******

Introduction
============

This library packages `node-uuid`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`node-uuid`: https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.uuid``) are published to some URL.
