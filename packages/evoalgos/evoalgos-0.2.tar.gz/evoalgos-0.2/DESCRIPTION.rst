Description
===========

This package contains the S-metric selection evolutionary multi-objective
optimization algorithm (SMS-EMOA) and the non-dominated sorting genetic
algorithm 2 (NSGA2). Currently, the algorithms can only work on real-valued
search spaces.

The package is geared to work with optimization problems as defined in the
package optproblems, but the dependency is not enforced because the necessary
interface could also be mimicked.

In the future, the package shall be extended by other algorithms.
