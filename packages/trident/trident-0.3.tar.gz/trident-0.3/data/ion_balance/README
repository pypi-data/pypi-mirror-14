Data files for ion_balance are too large for the code repository and 
must be downloaded manually.  Files are located at: 

http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance

Naming convention is <model>_<resolution>.h5. 
Example hm2012_hr.h5 is Haardt Madau 2012, High Resolution.

We recommend using hm2012_hr.h5, but it is 1.6GB, so we provide hm2012_lr.h5 
as a backup.

You can download them as:

wget http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance/hm2012_hr.h5
wget http://trident-project.org/data/ion_balance/hm2012_lr.h5
