A Python command-line utility for recursively applying a command to a filesystem tree.

The program works by walking the filesystem tree (either the value of ``-r``, if supplied, or the current working directory) using Python's ``os.walk``.  The program is invoked with a string specifying a command to be executed at each directory in the tree.  In each directory, each file (and sub-directory, if ``-d`` is specified) is matched against the list of include and exclude patterns specified at the command line.  If a file (and/or directory) matches an include pattern and does not match any exclude patterns, the command is executed with that file (or directory) name as an argument.  If no include patterns are specified, the program applies the command to all files (or directories) that do not match any exclude pattern.

Installation
------------
::

    $ pip install -U fmap

Usage
-----
::

    Usage: fmap [-h] [-p] [-v] [-d] [-l] [-b] [-z <depth>] [-x <pattern>] [-r <dir>]
         <cmd> [<pattern> [<pattern> ...]]

    Recursively apply a command to a filesystem tree.

    positional arguments:
      <cmd>                 The command to apply. The file to be applied may be
			    optionally specified by '{}'. If '{}' is not
			    supplied, the file will be passed in as the last
			    argument.
      <pattern>             Unix filename pattern that specifies which files to
			    apply the command to.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
      -p, --preview         Doesn't apply the command. Instead, prints command
			    invocations that would be performed.
      -v, --verbose         Print command invocations as they are performed.
      -d, --apply-dirs      Apply the command to directories after it is applied
			    to files at each level of the tree.
      -l, --follow-links    Follow symbolic links.
      -b, --bottom-up       Walk the tree from the bottom up. By default, the tree
			    is traversed from the top down.
      -z <depth>, --max-depth <depth>
			    Maximum recursion depth. Any negative number results
			    in unlimited recursion. Default is -1.
      -x <pattern>, --exclude <pattern>
			    Unix pattern that specifies which files to exclude
			    applying the command to.
      -r <dir>, --root <dir> Directory in which to begin the traversal. Is the
			    current directory by default.

Examples
--------

Suppose you have a directory structure under ``/root``, like so::

   .profile
   file1
   file2
   dir1/
       file3
       dir3/
           file4
   dir2/
       file5

As a trivial example, to list all the file paths under the current directory::

    $ pwd
    /root

    $ fmap echo
    /root/file1
    /root/file2
    /root/.profile
    /root/dir2/file5
    /root/dir1/file3
    /root/dir1/dir3/file4

To exclude certain patterns, use the ``-x`` option::

   $ fmap -x .profile echo
   /root/file1
   /root/file2
   /root/dir2/file5
   /root/dir1/file3
   /root/dir1/dir3/file4

   $ fmap -x '.*' -x file[35] echo
   /root/file1
   /root/file2
   /root/dir1/dir3/file4

Remember to quote any wildcard patterns to prevent them from being expanded by the shell.

By default, the command is applied to all files.  However, you can specify include patterns after the command::

    $ fmap echo file1 file[35]
    /root/file1
    /root/dir2/file5
    /root/dir1/file3

Include and exclude patterns can be combined::

    $ fmap -x file[35] echo 'file*'
    /root/file1
    /root/file2
    /root/dir1/dir3/file4

By default, the command is not applied to directories. This can changed, however, by supplying ``-d``::

   $ fmap -d echo
   /root/file1
   /root/file2
   /root/.profile
   /root/dir2
   /root/dir1
   /root/dir2/file5
   /root/dir1/file3
   /root/dir1/dir3
   /root/dir1/dir3/file4

The command is applied to directories after it has been applied to all applicable files at that level.

By default, the file tree is walked top-down.  To walk the tree bottom-up, supply the ``-b`` option::

   $ fmap -b echo
   /root/dir2/file5
   /root/dir1/dir3/file4
   /root/dir1/file3
   /root/file1
   /root/file2
   /root/.profile

To print out the command invocation as it is executed, supply ``-v``::

   $ fmap -v echo
   echo /root/file1
   /root/file1
   echo /root/file2
   /root/file2
   echo /root/.profile
   /root/.profile
   echo /root/dir2/file5
   /root/dir2/file5
   echo /root/dir1/file3
   /root/dir1/file3
   echo /root/dir1/dir3/file4
   /root/dir1/dir3/file4

To preview which command invocations will take place without actually invoking them, use the ``-p`` option::

   $ fmap -p 'rm -f' 'file*'
   rm -f /root/file1
   rm -f /root/file2
   rm -f /root/dir2/file5
   rm -f /root/dir1/file3
   rm -f /root/dir1/dir3/file4

However, no files will actually be deleted using the above command.

Remember to quote the command invocation if it includes arguments or subcommands.  You can also use ``{}`` to specify where the file path should be inserted into the command invocation::

   $ fmap -v 'echo {} >> out'
   echo /root/file1 >> /root/out
   echo /root/file2 >> /root/out
   echo /root/.profile >> /root/out
   echo /root/dir2/file5 >> /root/out
   echo /root/dir1/file3 >> /root/out
   echo /root/dir1/dir3/file4 >> /root/out

   $ cat out
   /root/file1
   /root/file2
   /root/.profile
   /root/dir2/file5
   /root/dir1/file3
   /root/dir1/dir3/file4
