'''Graph construction algorithms, including:

 - k-nearest and epsilon-close neighbors, with incremental variants
 - b-matching
 - directed graph construction
 - Delaunay and Gabriel graphs
 - Relative Neighborhood graphs
 - Manifold Spanning graphs
 - Sparse Regularized graphs
 - traditional, perturbed, and disjoint Minimum Spanning Trees
 - random graphs

Each construction function returns a Graph object.
