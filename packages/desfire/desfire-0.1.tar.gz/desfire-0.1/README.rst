Features
--------

* Compatibile with USB-based NFC readers via PCSC interface. PCSC API is available on Linux, OSX and Windows. Linux support includes support for Raspberry Pi.

* Compatibile with Android mobile phones and their built-in NFC readers. This is done using `Kivy <https://kivy.org/>`_ cross application Python framework and native Android APIs via `pyjnius <https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius>`_ Python to Java bridging.

* Only some of the commands are implemented in the current alpha quality version, please feel free to add more.

Background
----------

`The communication protocol specification is not public <http://stackoverflow.com/a/24069446/315168>`_. The work is based on reverse engineering existing open source DESFire projects, namely `Android host card emulation for DESFire <https://github.com/jekkos/android-hce-desfire>`_ and `MIFARE SDK <https://www.mifare.net/en/products/tools/mifare-sdk/>`_.
