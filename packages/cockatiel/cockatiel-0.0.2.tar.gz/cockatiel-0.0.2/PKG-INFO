        **THIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL, DON'T USE IT IN PRODUCTION (YET)**
        
        Cockatiel is a replicating file server for small-scale setups. It is intended
        to be used e.g. for handling user-uploaded files to a web application
        in a redundant way.
        
        Cockatiel doesn't try to be a CDN, but to implement the simplest
        solution that fulfills our needs. Currently, cockatiel makes the following
        assumptions. If those won't work for you, you should probably be looking
        for a CDN-like solution.
        
        Cockatiel makes some very strong assumption about your use case, be sure to
        read them in our [Documentation](https://cockatiel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/design.html#assumptions)
        before you decide to use cockatiel.

        available that uses cockatiel.
