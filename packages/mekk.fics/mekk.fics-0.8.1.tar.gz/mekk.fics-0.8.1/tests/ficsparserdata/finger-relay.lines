 1: use "tell relay help commands" to find more about relay commands
 2: use "tell relay observe" to automatically observe the highest rated 
\   relayed game
 3: use "tell relay gtm <game_number> <move>" (eg tell relay gtm 54 Nf3) to 
\   guess the next move
 4: I will keep the score and you can check how people are doing with "tell 
\   relay gtmrank".
 5: Accepted notation is reduced algebraic, thus e4 works but e2e4 does not. 
\   Similarly Nxe5 works but NxN does not. To guess castling use o-o or o-o-o 
\   but not e1g1.
 6: Use "tell relay notify" if you want to be told what tournaments are being 
\   relayed when you login
 7: http://www.freechess.org/Events/Relay/ and 
\   http://www.freechess.org/Events/Relay/2010 to see what tournaments are or 
\   will be relayed
