 1: "But I don't want to go among MAd people." Alice remarked
\   "Oh, you can't help that," said the cat: "We are all MAd here,
\   I'm MAd, you're MAd."
\   "How do you know I'm MAd?" said Alice.
\   "You must be." said the cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."

\   "Will you tell me something?
\   "Perhaps."
\   "When I dream, sometimes I remember how to fly. You just lift one leg,
\   then you lift the other leg, and you're not standing on anything, and you
\   can fly. And then when I wake up I can't remember how to do it any more."
\   "So?"
\   "So what I want to know is, when I'm asleep, do I really remember how to
\   fly? And forget how when I wake up? Or am I just dreaming I can fly?
\   "When you dream, sometimes you remember. When you wake, you always
\   forget."
\   "But that's not fair..."
\   "No."

\   If our game is adjourned I will ask for an abort: since it is a blitz 
\   chess game, the possibility that one of the players analyzes the position 
\   has to be ruled out. If you insist on playing I'll let you win on time and
\   you'll end up on my noplay. If you refuse to resign when you're lost and I
\   have lot of time I will noplay you too. I don't want to be be bored till I
\   bluder a piece, I'm here to enjoy the game.
