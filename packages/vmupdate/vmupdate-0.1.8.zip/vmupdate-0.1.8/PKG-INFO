        **vmupdate** is a command line utility used to keep your virtual machines up to date. It searches your computer for
        virtualizers, queries them for a list of VM's, and runs the appropriate update commands.

        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        The recommended installation tool is **pip**:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install vmupdate
        
        =====
        Usage
        =====
        
        Running vmupdate is just as easy:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ vmupdate
        
        Or specify a custom config:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ vmupdate --config "/path/to/config.yaml"
        
        Or logging directory:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ vmupdate --logdir "/path/to/logdir"
        
        =============
        Configuration
        =============
        
        -----
        Basic
        -----
        
        This method is included for simplicity, but is not recommended due to the inherent insecurity of a plaintext password.
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            Credentials:
              Username: myuser
              Password: mypass
        
        --------
        Keyring
        --------
        
        If a ``Password`` is not specified and ``Use Keyring`` is ``True`` (default) the password will be retrieved from your
        host OS's keyring provider first under the name of your VM and then under the general key ``vmupdate``.
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            Credentials:
              Username: myuser
        
        --------
        Machines
        --------
        
        The ``Machines`` section of the config file allows some options to be overriden at the VM level by name.
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            Machines:
              My Ubuntu Box:
                Username: myuser1
                Password: mypass
              My Arch Box:
                Username: myuser2
                Use Keyring: true
        
        If a ``Password`` is not specified and ``Use Keyring`` is ``True`` the password will be retrieved from your host OS's
        keyring provider under the name of the VM (i.e. ``My Arch Box``) and then under the general key ``vmupdate``.
        
        ========
        Features
        ========
        
        This list will continue expanding with later iterations of the tool.
        
        ------------
        Virtualizers
        ------------
        
        * Windows
            * VirtualBox
        
        ------
        Guests
        ------
        
        * Arch
            * pacman
        * Ubuntu
            * apt-get
        
        ===============
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        ----
        SSH
        ----
        
        SSH is used to communicate with VM's so you will need an SSH server enabled on each virtual machine. This is
        often then case by default with many \*nix installations, but may have to be installed separately.
        
        ---------------
        Port Forwarding
        ---------------
        
        An attempt will be made to forward port 22 on each VM to a unique port on the host if such a forward does not already
        exist. This only needs to be done once per virtual machine and can only occur if the VM is in a *stopped* state. If
        the automatic port forwarding fails, you can configure it yourself using your virtualizer.
        
        ----------------
        PyCrypto Install
        ----------------
        
        If you get a PyCrypto build error during installation please see the `paramiko install docs
        <http://www.paramiko.org/installing.html#pycrypto>`_.
