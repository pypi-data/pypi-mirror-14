Description: more.transaction: SQLAlchemy and ZODB integration for Morepath
        ==============================================================
        
        more.transaction builds on the transaction_ module to let you
        integrate SQLAlchemy or ZODB (or both!) into Morepath_ applications.
        
        See https://github.com/morepath/morepath_sqlalchemy for a demo.

        CHANGES
        *******
        
        0.6 (2016-04-06)
        ================
        
        - Adds compatibility with Morepath 0.13.
        
        0.5 (2015-08-17)
        ================
        
        - Fixes transaction retries not working for paths with more than one variable.
          
          This bug had no effect on applications using the default more.transaction
          settings. The bug only concerned applications using an ``attempts`` setting
          greater than 1.
        
          See https://github.com/morepath/more.transaction/issues/3
        
        0.4 (2015-01-06)
        ================
        
        - Rename ``transaction_app`` to ``TransactionApp`` to be consistent
          with modern class naming in Morepath. Still provide
          ``transaction_app`` for backwards compatibility.
        
        - Modify ``setup.py`` to use ``io.open`` instead of ``open`` to
          include the README and the CHANGELOG and hardcode UTF-8 so it works
          on all versions of Python with all default encodings.
        
        0.3 (2014-11-03)
        ================
        
        - Compatibility fixes for Morepath 0.7.
        
        0.2 (2014-11-01)
        ================
        
        - Adjustments to work with Morepath 0.4 and later. (long overdue release,
          thanks Denis Krienbühl for helping me find out!)
        
        0.1 (2014-04-08)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release.
