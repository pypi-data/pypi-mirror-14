##3xsd
3xsd is a native epoll server serving TCP/UDP connections, a high performance static web server, a
failover dns server, a http-based distributed file server, a load-balance proxy-cache server, and
a 'warp drive' server. Written in python, take the full power of multi-cores.

##Features in detail:

###3wsd - web server
       supporting: static files, event driven(epoll), using mmap & sendfile to send files,
       in-mem xcache, transparent gzip content transfer with fixed length(small file) & 
       chunked(large file), persistent storage of gzip files,
       partial support of WebDAV(PUT/DELETE), pipelining support
       
###3nsd - dns server
       supporting: only A record resolution, domainname failover(refer to conf file),
       ip icmp probe & hide when fail, round robbin ip resolving
       
###3zsd - proxy server
       supporting: load balance backend servers, in-mem file caching & 
       persistent cache file storage

###3fsd - distribute web file system
       supporting: mass unlimitted file storage, easy to expand,
       O(1) location algorithm, non-centralized, can work with standard web server(WebDAV)
       in proxy mode, file redundancy, file persistent caching

###3wdd - 'warp drive' server
	supporting: data tunneling over UDT and tun,
	better congestion control than TCP/UDP over wan link,
	better thoughput(above 80%) over wan link,
	tunnel ip/mtu/txqueuelen/route define, auto create/recreate/destroy
	encrypt packages through AES-128-ECB/CBC/CFB
	tunnel on-the-fly compress with zlib/lzo

More to find in .conf file.

##Performance:

###3wsd:
  Small file under 1KB single process test(full in-mem), contrast with nginx configuring
  accept_mutex off, 80% performance.
  Multi processes test, with reuse_port enabling kernel, 95% performance of nginx(and beyond,
  may be 105% or more, based on process number, I tested 2-4).
  The tests above is not quite strictï¼Œ but I just want to say that it's fast enough.

  And with pipelining enabled, 3wsd will perform better with 3-4 requests/send(5%-10%
  performance increase), 2 requests/send have the same speed with non-piplining.

###3zsd:
  About 80% performance of 3wsd.
  
###3nsd:
  Fast enough...about 2800-3000 queries/s per processes, with 1GHz bcm2709 4-cores ARMv7
  cpu testing, better when multi-processes with reuse_port enabling kernel.
  
###3fsd:
  Same with 3zsd.
  
###3wdd:
  Early testing indicated that:
  UDT tunnel(no encrypt) performing 50%-60% speed of direct TCP connection with ZetaTCP,
  and package lost rate remaining below 0.6%, while direct connection has 1.4%-3%.
  (Test CN-US WAN link with 150ms-280ms latency, through the always-jammed CUCN submarine cable)
  However, UDT tunnel beats normal TCP connection without ZetaTCP, with 30%-50% outperforming.(v)
  (Test link like above)And an encrypted UDT tunnel will has 50% performance decrease.

###More performance:
There are at lease two ways to increase the performance of 3xsd:

       1.Install Cython, and rename _3xsd.py to _3xsd.pyx, run it. 
       Cython will compile _3xsd.py lib into a _3xsd.so file, using static type
       declarations. This can gain about 5%-6% performance increasement.
       2.Use PyPy.This can gain about 10%-15% performance increasement(or more).

#OS requirement & install: 

CentOS 6/7 with python 2.6/2.7, Debian 6/7. Python 2.7 recommended.

Doing this before running the program(minimal requirement):

       yum install python-gevent pysendfile python-setproctitle python-psutil python-pip
       
       (python-pip is optional if install dpkt)
  
Dpkt module is also needed when running 3nsd DNS server, pip install it.

If you want to use 3wdd, python-pytun, pyudt4, pycrypto, python-lzo are also needed.

       yum install python-crypto2.6

will quickly install pycrypto(probably do some 'linking' works). The other two depended on pip install.

Or, of cause you can let pip do it all for you:

       pip install 3xsd

In a debian, you can use apt-get to install python-pip(pip) or python-setuptools(easy_install),
then to install the packages following.

Python Packages(Modules) version reference:

       gevent==0.13.8(1.0.1, 1.1)
       greenlet==0.4.2
       pysendfile==2.0.1
       setproctitle==1.0.1
       psutil==0.6.1
       dpkt==1.6(1.8.6)
       python-pytun==2.2.1
       pyudt4==0.6.0(epoll-fixes branch)
       pycrypto==2.6.1

To install a module of specific version(like gevent 0.13.8), you can:

       pip install gevent==0.13.8

This will install the latest version of gevent(pypy will need it):

       pip install git+git://github.com/surfly/gevent.git#egg=gevent
