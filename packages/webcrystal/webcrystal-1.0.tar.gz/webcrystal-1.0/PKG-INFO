        ==========
        
        webcrystal is:
        
        1. An HTTP proxy and web service that saves every web page accessed
           through it to disk.
        2. An on-disk archival format for storing websites.
        
        webcrystal is intended as a tool for archiving websites. It is intended
        to be convenient to write HTTP-based web scrapers and browser-based web
        scrapers on top of.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Compact package: One .py file. Only one dependency (``urllib3``).
        -  A simple documented archival format.
        -  >95% code coverage, enforced by the test suite.
        -  Friendly MIT license.
        -  Excellent documentation.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install webcrystal
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        To start the proxy run a command like:
        
        ::
        
            webcrystal.py 9227 xkcd.wbcr http://xkcd.com/
        
        Then you can visit http://localhost:9227/ to have the same effect as
        visiting http://xkcd.com/ directly, except that all requests are
        archived in ``xkcd.wbcr/``.
        
        When you access an HTTP resource through the webcrystal proxy for the
        first time, it will be fetched from the origin HTTP server and archived
        locally. All subsequent requests for the same resource will be returned
        from the archive.
        
        CLI
        ---
        
        To start the webcrystal proxy:
        
        ::
        
            webcrystal.py [--help] [--quiet] <port> <archive_dirpath> [<default_origin_domain>]
        
        To stop the proxy press ^C or send a SIGINT signal to it.
        
        Full Syntax
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            webcrystal.py --help
        
        This outputs:
        
        ::
        
            usage: webcrystal.py [-h] [-q] port archive_dirpath [default_origin_domain]
        
            An archiving HTTP proxy and web service.
        
            positional arguments:
              port                  Port on which to run the HTTP proxy. Suggest 9227
                                    (WBCR).
              archive_dirpath       Path to the archive directory. Usually has .wbcr
                                    extension.
              default_origin_domain
                                    Default HTTP domain which the HTTP proxy will redirect
                                    to if no URL is specified.
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
              -q, --quiet           Suppresses all output.
        
        HTTP API
        --------
        
        The HTTP API is the primary API for interacting with the webcrystal
        proxy.
        
        While the proxy is running, it responds to the following HTTP endpoints.
        
        Notice that GET is an accepted method for all endpoints, so that they
        can be easily requested using a regular web browser. Browser
        accessibility is convenient for manual inspection and browser-based
        website scrapers.
        
        ``GET,HEAD /``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Redirects to the home page of the default origin domain if it was
        specified at the CLI. Returns:
        
        -  HTTP 404 (Not Found) if no default origin domain is specified (the
           default) or
        -  HTTP 307 (Temporary Redirect) to the default origin domain if it is
           specified.
        
        ``GET,HEAD /_/http[s]/__PATH__``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If in online mode (the default):
        
        -  The requested resource will be fetched from the origin server and
           added to the archive if:
        
           -  
        
              (1) it is not already archived,
        
           -  
        
              (2) a ``Cache-Control=no-cache`` header is specified, or
        
           -  
        
              (3) a ``Pragma=no-cache`` header is specified.
        
        -  The newly archived resource will be returned to the client, with all
           URLs in HTTP headers and content rewritten to point to the proxy.
        
        If in offline mode:
        
        -  If the resource is in the archive, it will be returned to the client,
           with all URLs in HTTP headers and content rewritten to point to the
           proxy.
        -  If the resource is not in the archive, an HTTP 503 (Service
           Unavailable) response will be returned, with an HTML page that
           provides a link to the online version of the content.
        
        ``POST,GET /_online``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Switches the proxy to online mode.
        
        ``POST,GET /_offline``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Switches the proxy to offline mode.
        
        ``POST,GET /_refresh/http[s]/__PATH__``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Refetches the specified URL from the origin server using the same
        request headers as the last time it was fetched. Returns:
        
        -  HTTP 200 (OK) if successful or
        -  HTTP 404 (Not Found) if the specified URL was not in the archive.
        
        ``POST,GET /_delete/http[s]/__PATH__``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Deletes the specified URL in the archive. Returns:
        
        -  HTTP 200 (OK) if successful or
        -  HTTP 404 (Not Found) if the specified URL was not in the archive.
        
        Archival Format
        ---------------
        
        When the proxy is started with a command like:
        
        ::
        
            webcrystal.py 9227 website.wbcr
        
        It creates an archive in the directory ``website.wbcr/`` in the
        following format:
        
        ``website.wbcr/index.txt``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Lists the URL of each archived HTTP resource, one per line.
        -  UTF-8 encoded text file with Unix line endings (``\n``).
        
        Example:
        
        ::
        
            http://xkcd.com/
            http://xkcd.com/s/b0dcca.css
            http://xkcd.com/1645/
        
        The preceding example archive contains 3 HTTP resources, numbered #1,
        #2, and #3.
        
        ``website.wbcr/1.request_headers.json``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Contains the HTTP request headers sent to the origin HTTP server to
           obtain HTTP resource #1.
        -  UTF-8 encoded JSON file.
        
        Example:
        
        ::
        
            {"Accept-Language": "en-us", "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8", "Host": "xkcd.com", "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate", "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3) AppleWebKit/601.4.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0.3 Safari/601.4.4"}
        
        ``website.wbcr/1.response_headers.json``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Contains the HTTP response headers received from the origin HTTP
           server when obtaining HTTP resource #1.
        -  UTF-8 encoded JSON file.
        -  Contains an internal "X-Status-Code" header that indicates the HTTP
           status code received from the origin HTTP server.
        
        Example:
        
        ::
        
            {"Cache-Control": "public", "Connection": "keep-alive", "Accept-Ranges": "bytes", "X-Cache-Hits": "0", "Date": "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 04:37:05 GMT", "Age": "0", "X-Served-By": "cache-sjc3628-SJC", "Content-Type": "text/html", "Server": "lighttpd/1.4.28", "X-Status-Code": "404", "X-Cache": "MISS", "Content-Length": "345", "X-Timer": "S1458016625.375814,VS0,VE148", "Via": "1.1 varnish"}
        
        ``website.wbcr/1.response_body.dat``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Contains the contents of the HTTP response body received from the
           origin HTTP server when obtaining HTTP resource #1.
        -  Binary file.

        Known Limitations
        -----------------
        
        -  Sites that vary the content served at a particular URL depending on
           whether you are logged in can have only one version of the URL
           archived.
