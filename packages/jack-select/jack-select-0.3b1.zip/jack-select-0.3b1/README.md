# jack-select

A systray application to quickly change the [JACK] configuration from QjackCtl
presets via DBus.

Overview
--------

This application displays an icon in the system tray (also known as
notification area) of your desktop, which shows the status of the JACK audio
server and when you click on it, a menu pops up which lets you quickly select
from the JACK configuration presets you created with [QjackCtl]. When you
select a preset, its JACK engine and driver configuration settings are loaded
via DBus into JACK and then the server is restarted. This allows you to switch
between different audio setups with just two mouse clicks.

When you hover with the mouse pointer over the systray icon and JACK is
running, a tooltip will show you the most important parameters of the current
setup.

Lastly, there are menu entries to stop the JACK server and to quit the
application.

To create or edit presets, just use the QjackCtl configuration dialog and make
sure you close it with "Ok" so the changes are saved. jack-select will pick up
the changes automatically.


Installation
------------

To install jack-select on your system for everybody, check and install the
requirements below and then run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/SpotlightKid/jack-select
    $ cd jack-select
    $ [sudo] make PREFIX=/usr install

This will install the `jack-select` program, the `jackselect` Python package
and the `jack-select.desktop` file and the `jack-select.png` icon to provide a
desktop start menu entry. It will also install the required Python dependencies
if they haven't been installed yet. Installing `PyGObject` probably won't work
this way, so make sure it is installed some other way beforehand, e.g. via
your distributions package management.

If you want to install jack-select only for the current user, replace the
last command above with:

    $ make install-user


You can start jack-select from your desktop's XDG-compatible start menu or add
it to your autostart folder (e.g. `~/.config/autostart`) to have it started
along your desktop.


Requirements
------------

This application works with the DBus-version of JACK only.

It written in Python 3 using the [PyGobject] bindings for GTK 3. In addition to
this, the following third-party Python libraries are required:

* [pyxdg](http://freedesktop.org/Software/pyxdg)
* [dbus-python](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings/)

These may be available from the package repository of your distribution as
`python-gobject`, `python-xdg` and `python-dbus` respectively.

Python 2 is not supported.
