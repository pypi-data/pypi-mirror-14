Elasticsearch Curator Python API
================================

The Elasticsearch Curator Python API helps you manage your indices and
snapshots.

.. note::

   This documentation is for the Elasticsearch Curator Python API.  Documentation
   for the Elasticsearch Curator *CLI* -- which uses this API and is installed
   as an entry_point as part of the package -- is available in the
   `Elastic guide`_.

.. _Elastic guide: http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html

Compatibility
-------------

The Elasticsearch Curator Python API is compatible with Elasticsearch versions 1.x
through 2.0, and supports Python versions 2.6 and later.

Example Usage
-------------

::

    import elasticsearch
    import curator

    client = elasticsearch.Elasticsearch()

    curator.close_indices(client, ['logstash-2014.08.16','logstash-2014.08.17'])
    curator.disable_bloom_filter(client, 'logstash-2014.08.31')
    curator.optimize_index(client, 'logstash-2014.08.31')
    curator.delete(client, ['logstash-2014.07.16', 'logstash-2014.07.17'])

.. TIP::
    See more examples in the :doc:`Examples </examples>` page.

Features
--------

The API methods fall into the following categories:

* :doc:`Commands </commands>` take a single index, or in some cases a list of indices and perform an action on them.
* :doc:`Filters </filters>` are there to filter indices or snapshots based on provided criteria.
* :doc:`Utilities </utilities>` are helper methods for commands and filters.

Filtering indices is now handled by the :py:func:`curator.api.build_filter` method.

Logging
~~~~~~~

The Elasticsearch Curator Python API uses the standard `logging library`_ from Python.
It inherits two loggers from ``elasticsearch-py``: ``elasticsearch`` and
``elasticsearch.trace``. Clients use the ``elasticsearch`` logger to log
standard activity, depending on the log level. The ``elasticsearch.trace``
logger logs requests to the server in JSON format as pretty-printed ``curl``
commands that you can execute from the command line. The ``elasticsearch.trace``
logger is not inherited from the base logger and must be activated separately.
