Summary
~~~~~~~

From the
{ref}/indices-open-close.html[Elasticsearch Open/Close API documentation]

________________________________________________________________________________
The open and close index APIs allow to close an index, and later on re-open it.
A closed index has almost no overhead on the cluster (except for maintaining its
metadata & the disk space it consumes), and is blocked for read/write
operations. A closed index can be opened which will then go through the normal
recovery process.
________________________________________________________________________________

The `open` command makes it possible to re-open closed indices in a scripted
way.
