== Exit Codes

New in Curator version 3, exit codes will indicate success or failure.

* `0` — Success
* `1` — Failure

NOTE: Up until Curator version 3.2.0, exit code `99` existed.  This indicated
that there were no matching indices to act on, but otherwise no failure existed.
A warning message that no matching indices were found is still shown, but
Curator now returns exit code 0.
