[[master-only]]
== --master-only

Summary
~~~~~~~

In some situations, primarily with automated deployments, it makes sense to
install curator on every node. But you wouldn't want it to _run_ on each node.
With the `--master-only` flag, this is possible. It tests for, and will only
continue running on the node that is the elected master.
