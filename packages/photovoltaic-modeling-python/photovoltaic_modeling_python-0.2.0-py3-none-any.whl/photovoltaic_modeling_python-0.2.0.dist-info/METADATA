# PhotovoltaicModelingPython

In order to get the parameters that are not available in the datasheet of photovoltaic modules, equations derived from the diode model are used. Due to the complexity of the equations, numerical method is used to get the parameters.  

## Installation

#### Required packages

* numpy

* scipy

Automatically installed when this package is installed. 

#### Installation instruction

Use ``pip3``:

```
pip3 install photovoltaic_modeling
```

## Supported Platforms

* Python 3.5. 

It's not tested on Python 2.6 or 2.7 yet. 

### Assumptions

* Unit of temperature voltage coefficient: [V/ºC] not [%/ºC]. 

Different datasheets use different unit (either one of these units). If it's given in [%/ºC] in datasheet, make sure to convert it to [V/ºC]. 

* Unit of temperature current coefficient: [A/ºC] not [%/ºC]. 

Different datasheets use different unit (either one of these units). If it's given in [%/ºC] in datasheet, make sure to convert it to [A/ºC].

* Definition of thermal voltage:

```
    Vt = (AkT) / q

    where, Vt: Thermal voltage, A: Diode quality factor, k: Boltzmann constant, T: Temperature at Standard Test Condition (STC),  q: charge of electron
```
This is the definition from reference [1]

Some literatures use 
```
    Vt = (nkT) / q

    where, n: number of cells in series
```
For example, reference [2]

But this project uses the first definition above and all the equations are adjusted accordingly.  

## Usage

### Code examples






### Command line execution

Examples: 

* Parameter Extraction:

```
    $ photovoltaic_modeling parameter_extraction --short_circuit_current 3.87 --open_circuit_voltage 42.1 --maximum_power_point_current 3.56 --maximum_power_point_voltage 33.7 --number_of_cells_in_series 72
```
