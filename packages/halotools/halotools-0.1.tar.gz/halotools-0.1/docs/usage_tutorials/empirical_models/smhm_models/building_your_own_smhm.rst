***************************************************************
Building your own Model of the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation
***************************************************************

This section of the documentation describes how you can build your own 
component model of the relationship between central galaxy stellar mass 
and host halo mass (aka an SMHM model). Any SMHM model is a 
*component model* that can be composed together with other 
such components into a *composite model* using one of the 
Halotools *model factories*. For an overview of the general design 
principles underlying Halotools model factories, 
see :ref:`building_your_own_galaxy_halo_model`.
