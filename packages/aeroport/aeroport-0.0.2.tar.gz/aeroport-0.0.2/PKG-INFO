        Organize hub for data arrival / departures
        
        Idea is to build server for running scraping jobs from multiple sources and input formats (web sites,
        data feeds, etc...), adapt data and deliver it further to destinations (e. g. processing queues).
        
        So it's like an airport where each airline "declares" its own arrivals, destinations and transport,
        while using common hub insfrastructure.
