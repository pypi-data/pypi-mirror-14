Description: Descriptions can be found in the markdown `README
        <https://github.com/Zaeb0s/max-subthreads/blob/master/README.md>`_.
        
        New features:
        
        V.0.2.0
           - start_thread now returns the Thread object
        
        V.0.3.0
          - Added ThreadStarter Class. This class can run a separate thread for the sole purpose of starting threads with MaxThreads
        
        V.0.4.0
          - Removed ThreadStarter Class because the new way start_thread is written makes this class obsolete (it no longer blocks while waiting for a thread to become available).
        
        V.0.5.0
          - Added the ability to prioritize tasks started by start_thread
