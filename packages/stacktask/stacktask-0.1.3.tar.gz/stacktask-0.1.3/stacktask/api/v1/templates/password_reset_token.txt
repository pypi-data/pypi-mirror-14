Hello,

To reset your OpenStack user password follow this link:
{{ tokenurl }}{{ token }}/

This link will expire in 24 hours at which point you will need to request another one.

If you did not request this reset, either ignore this email and allow it to expire, or get in touch with your infrastructure admins if you are worried.

Thank you for using our service.
