Hello,

Someone has invited you to join their OpenStack project.
Project id: {{ actions.NewUser.project_id }}
Roles:{% for role in actions.NewUser.roles %}
- {{ role }}{% endfor %}

To complete this invitation just follow this link:
{{ tokenurl }}{{ token }}/

If you are a new user you will just have to setup your password for a user with this email address, but if you already have a user, you simply have to confirm your invitation. 

This link will expire in 24 hours at which point you will need to request another one from the person who invited you.

Thank you for using our service.
