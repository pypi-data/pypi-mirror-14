        Usage
        -----
        
        All filters take a location as a dict with ``latitude`` and ``longitude`` keys.
        You can also pass an object with these attributes.
        
        Before using any template you need to add the filters to your Jinja2
        environment: ::
        
          from jinja2_maps import activate_filters
          activate_filters(your_env)
        
        If using Flask you can do the following: ::
        
          from jinja2_maps import activate_filters
          activate_filters(app.jinja_env)
        
        URLs
        ~~~~
        
        ::
          <a href="{{ your_location | osm_url }}">Check on OpenStreetMap</a>
          <a href="{{ your_location | gmaps_url }}">Check on Google Maps</a>
        
        Maps
        ~~~~
        
        ::
          {{ your_location | osm_map(width=500, height=400) }}
