## List of 'fgfs' command line options. Enable the options you want to use by
## removing the hash symbol at the beginning of the appropriate lines.

## RENDERING OPTIONS
## Enable fullscreen mode.
#--enable-fullscreen

## Specify the geometry of FlightGear's window (no need to specify it if you
## use --enable-fullscreen).
#--geometry=800x600

## Enable anti-aliasing. This can improve the visual quality of FlightGear's
## rendering, especially at low resolutions, but is also likely to reduce the
## frame rate. See <http://wiki.flightgear.org/Anti-aliasing> for details.
#--prop:/sim/rendering/multi-sample-buffers=true
#--prop:/sim/rendering/multi-samples=4

## OTHER
## Enter your callsign. Note that it's currently limited to seven characters.
## Please don't choose a callsign already in use by someone else on the
## multiplayer network.
#--callsign=

## Enable automatic scenery download as you fly:
#--enable-terrasync
## ... or disable it in case it causes problems, or you just can't use it
## (for instance, if you are not connected to the Internet).
#--disable-terrasync

## If you want to choose the directory used for automatic scenery download
## (the default being $FG_HOME/TerraSync).
##
## Note: in FlightGear 2016.1.1, setting this to a directory that is not under
##       FG_HOME may cause failure to read some scenery files, due to
##       inadequate permissions rules[1]. This has normally been fixed[2] in
##       FlightGear commit 41b78ce1505aced494f588d6f3591c8af68a8bbe (dated
##       Sunday, Feb 21), therefore FlightGear 2016.2.1 and later should not
##       be affected.
