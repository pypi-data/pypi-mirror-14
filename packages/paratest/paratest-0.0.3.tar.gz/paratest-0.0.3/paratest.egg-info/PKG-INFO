Description: Parallelizes test executions.
        
        It is based on plugins in order to support different languages or platforms.
        
        It allows to parallelize the integration/acceptance tests execution in different environments. This way they will took much less time to finish.
        
        ParaTest can be run under any Continuous Integration Server, like Jenkins, TeamCity, Go-CD, Bamboo, etc.
        
        Current plugins
        ===============
        
        ParaTest is in an early development stage and it still have no plugins to work. It is just a proof of concept.

        Plugins
        -------
        
        Plugins should implement the next interface:
        
        - ``find(path, pattern)``: returns a list of test unique names ("TID", or "Test ID"), searching from ``path`` and filtering by ``pattern``.
        - ``run(id, tid, workspace, output_path)``: receives the worker ``id``, one ``tid`` returned by ``find`` in order to execute it, the ``workspace`` path to take input files and the ``output`` path to leave results.
