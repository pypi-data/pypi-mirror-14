distutils-pytest - Call pytest from a distutils setup.py script
===============================================================

This Python module adds ``test`` to the commands in the `distutils`_
package.  If your ``setup.py`` imports ``distutils_pytest``, the user
may run::

  python setup.py test

This will call `pytest`_ to run your package's test suite.


System requirements
-------------------

 + Python 2.6, 2.7, or 3.1 and newer.
 + `pytest`_

To be honest, the package might also work with older Python versions.
But I didn't try it.


Installation
------------

This package uses the `distutils`_ Python standard library package and
follows its conventions of packaging source distributions.  See the
documentation on `Installing Python Modules`_ for details or to
customize the install process.

  1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source
     directory.

  2. Build::

       $ python setup.py build

  3. Install::

       $ python setup.py install

The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.
