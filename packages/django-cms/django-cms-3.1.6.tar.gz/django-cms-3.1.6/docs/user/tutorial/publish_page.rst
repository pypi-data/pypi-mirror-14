Publish a page
##############

The page you were working on in the previous step - :doc:`/user/tutorial/create_page_content` - of this tutorial is not
yet published. It's currently in *Draft* mode, and only you and other users with permission to edit the page can see it.

To publish it so that ordinary web visitors will be able to see it, hit **Publish page now** |publish-page-now| (a
window alert will ask you for confirmation).

Using the toolbar you can make further changes to the page: just select the **Edit** |edit| button to activate *Edit
mode*. Notice how the ``?edit`` and ``?edit_off`` parameters are appended to the URL in your browser as you switch in
and out of *Edit* mode.

While your page remains in draft mode, you can continue working on it without affecting the published page.

Once you have finished editing, you can exit editing mode and save the page
using the **Save as draft** |save-as-draft| button.

You have now worked through the complete cycle of content publishing in django
CMS.

Publishing status in the *Page list*
====================================

A page's status is also indicated in the *Page list* (if it's not already visible, select the *Pages...* menu item from
the *Site menu*).

In the example below, the *Home* page is page is published (in English) but the *About* page is still only in *Draft* mode.
