Serverless WSGI with AWS Lambda + API Gateway

Zappa makes it super easy to deploy all Python WSGI applications on AWS
Lambda + API Gateway. Think of it as "serverless" web hosting for your
Python web apps.

That means:

-  **No more** tedious web server configuration!
-  **No more** paying for 24/7 server uptime!
-  **No more** worrying about load balancing / scalability!
-  **No more** worrying about keeping servers online!

**Awesome!**

This project is for the Zappa core library, which can be used by any
WSGI-compatible web framework (which is pretty much all of them.) This
library also handles:

-  Packaging projects into Lambda-ready zip files and uploading them to
   S3
-  Correctly setting up IAM roles and permissions
-  Automatically configuring API Gateway routes, methods and integration
   responses
-  Deploying the API to various stages of readiness

If you are looking for the version for your favorite web frameworks, you
should probably try here:

-  **`django-zappa <https://github.com/Miserlou/django-zappa>`__**
-  **`flask-zappa <https://github.com/Miserlou/flask-zappa>`__**
-  **pyramid-zappa** (Coming.. maybe?)

Usage
=====

If you just want to use Zappa to deploy your web application, you'll
probably want to use a client library like
`django-zappa <https://github.com/Miserlou/django-zappa>`__ instead.
But, if you want to create a new client library or use Zappa directly,
you can follow the steps below.

You can install Zappa through pip:

::

    $ pip install zappa

Then, you'll want to call its main capabilities in order:

.. code:: python


    # Set your configuration
    project_name = "MyProject"
    api_stage = "Production"
    s3_bucket_name = 'MyLambdaBucket'

    # Make your Zappa object
    zappa = Zappa()

    # Load your AWS credentials from ~/.aws/credentials
    zappa.load_credentials()

    # Make sure the necessary IAM execution roles are available
    zappa.create_iam_roles()

    # Create the Lambda zip package (includes project and virtualenvironment)
    zip_path = zappa.create_lambda_zip(project_name)

    # Upload it to S3
    zip_arn = zappa.upload_to_s3(zip_path, s3_bucket_name)

    # Register the Lambda function with that zip as the source
    # You'll also need to define the path to your lambda_handler code.
    lambda_arn = zappa.create_lambda_function(s3_bucket_name, zip_path, project_name, 'runme.lambda_handler')

    # Create and configure the API Gateway
    api_id = zappa.create_api_gateway_routes(lambda_arn)

    # Deploy the API!
    endpoint_url = zappa.deploy_api_gateway(api_id, api_stage)

    print("Your Zappa deployment is live!: " + endpoint_url)

And your application is
`live <https://7k6anj0k99.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod>`__!

Hacks
=====

Zappa goes quite far beyond what Lambda and API Gateway were ever
intended to handle. As a result, there are quite a few hacks in here
that allow it to work. Some of those include, but aren't limited to..

-  Using VTL to map body, headers, method, params and query strings into
   JSON, and then turning that into valid WSGI.
-  Attaching response codes to response bodies, Base64 encoding the
   whole thing, using that as a regex to route the response code,
   decoding the body in VTL, and mapping the response body to that.
-  Packing and *Base58* encoding multiple cookies into a single cookie
   because we can only map one kind.
-  Turning cookie-setting 301/302 responses into 200 responses with HTML
   redirects, because we have no way to set headers on redirects.

TODO
====

This project is very young, so there is still plenty to be done.
Contributions are more than welcome! Please file tickets before
submitting patches, and submit your patches to the 'dev' branch.

Things that need work right now:

-  Testing
-  Clients for frameworks besides Django
-  Feedback
-  Real documentation / website!
