Description: |Sappho Logo (A Lyre)|
        ======================
        
        Sappho is a 2D game engine written with Python and pygame.
        
        The purpose of this repo is to rewrite Hypatia Engine and eventually
        replace Hypatia Engine as "Sappho."
        
        Sorry I haven't had time to clean anything yet.
        
        Design Philosophy
        -----------------
        
        1. Don't interfere with the way people build their pygame games
        2. We are not automating game logic
        3. Sappho modules *may not* import other Sappho modules
        4. Inherit from pygame objects when possible; use conventional pygame
           models/architecture.
        5. Consistency.
        6. Simplicity trumps all else.
        7. Well documented.
        
        For more details see ``CONTRIBUTING.md``.
