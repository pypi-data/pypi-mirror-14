# Django-helpers

Some Django helpers I share between my projects

## usage

```
pip install https://github.com/jieter/django-helpers/archive/master.zip
```
There is no formal documentation and there will probably never be such a thing.


## Running the tests
```
mkvirtualenv helpers
make requirements
make test
```
