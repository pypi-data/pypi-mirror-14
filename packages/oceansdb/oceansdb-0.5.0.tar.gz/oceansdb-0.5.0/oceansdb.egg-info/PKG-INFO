        Package to subsample, or interpolate, World Ocean Atlas climatology to any coordinates.
        
        This package started with functions to obtain climatological values to compare with measured data, allowing a quality control check by comparison. It hence needed to work for any coordinates requested. I recently split these functionalities from CoTeDe into this standalone package to allow more people to use it for other purposes.

        Features
        --------
        
        * If the WOA database files are not localy available, download it.
        * Extract, or interpolate if necessary, climatologic data on requested coordinates;
        * Can request a single point, a profile or a section;
        * Ready to handle -180 to 180 or 0 to 360 coordinate system;
        
        Quick howto use
        ---------------
        
        Inside python:
        
            from oceansdb import WOA
        
            db = WOA()
        
        To get temperature at one point:
            t = db['TEMP'].extract(var='t_mn', doy=136.875, depth=0, lat=17.5, lon=-37.5)
        
        To get one profile of salinity:
            t = db['PSAL'].extract(var='t_mn', doy=136.875, depth=[0, 10, 15, 18], lat=17.5, lon=-37.5)
        
        To get a full depth section of temperature:
            t = db['TEMP'].extract(var='t_mn', doy=136.875, lat=17.5, lon=[-39, -37.5, -35])
        
        
        
        
        History
        -------
        
        0.4.0 (2015-03-29)
        ------------------
        
        * Added etopo5, a world wide bathymetry. Some of this code has its origins on pyAVISO and CoTeDe.
        
        0.2.0 (2015-03)
        ------------------
        
        * Renamed package to OceansDB, planning to include other climatologies and references.
        
        0.1.0 (2015-02-09)
        ------------------
        
        * Generalized interpolator. Extract climatology for point, profile or section.
        
        0.0.1 (2015-12-13)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI. Extracted from CoTeDe to be a standalone package.
        
        pre-released (~2006)
        --------------------
        
        * The first version was developed in support to quality control thermosalinographs at NOAA. It was later injected inside CoTeDe.
