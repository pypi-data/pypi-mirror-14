**********************************************************************
A cross-platform multi-screen shot module in pure python using ctypes
**********************************************************************

Very basic, it will grab one screen shot by monitor or a screen shot of all monitors and save it to a PNG file, Python 2.6/3.5 compatible & PEP8 compliant.

MSS stands for Multiple ScreenShots.

It's under zlib licence.


Installation
============

You can install it with pip::

    pip install --upgrade mss

Or you may just drop it in your project and forget about it.

Feel free to try MSS on a system we had not tested, and let report us by creating an [issue](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss/issues).


Testing
=======

You can try the MSS module directly from the console::

    python mss.py


Instance the good class
=======================

So MSS can be used as simply as::

    from mss import mss
    screenshotter = mss()

Or import the good one::

    from mss import MSSLinux as mss
    screenshotter = mss()


save(output, screen, callback)
------------------------------

For each monitor, grab a screenshot and save it to a file.

Parameters::

    output - string - the output filename. It can contain '%d' which
                      will be replaced by the monitor number.
    screen - integer - grab one screenshot of all monitors (screen=-1)
                       grab one screenshot by monitor (screen=0)
                       grab the screenshot of the monitor N (screen=N)
    callback - function - in case where output already exists, call
                          the defined callback function with output
                          as parameter. If it returns True, then
                          continue; else ignores the monitor and
                          switches to ne next.

This is a generator which returns created files.


Examples
========

One screenshot per monitor::

    for filename in screenshotter.save():
        print(filename)

Screenshot of the monitor 1::

    for filename in screenshotter.save(screen=1):
        print(filename)

Screenshot of the monitor 1, with callback::

    def on_exists(fname):
        ''' Callback example when we try to overwrite an existing
            screenshot.
        '''
        from os import rename
        from os.path import isfile
        if isfile(fname):
            newfile = fname + '.old'
            print('{0} -> {1}'.format(fname, newfile))
            rename(fname, newfile)
        return True

    for filename in screenshotter.save(screen=1, callback=on_exists):
        print(filename)

A screenshot to grab them all::

    for filename in screenshotter.save(output='fullscreen-shot.png', screen=-1):
        print(filename)
