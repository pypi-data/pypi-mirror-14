Description: Github Issues with Priorities
        =======================================
        
        Github does not provide natively the support of priorities for issues.
        Cloudmesh Github Issues introduces a simple way to do so while not using
        labels, but by augmenting the issue boddy.
        
        We provide a simple django bootstrap based portal interface that looks
        into the github issues and finds in the first line of an isse the
        priority defined with::
        
          P:10
        
        where 10 is the priority. If no priority is given we use 999
        indicating a low priority.
        
        
        Install
        --------
        
        The install requires an install from github so you are up to date and
        get all needed files. If you download the packae from pypi, we
        recommend that you do the github instalation instead. We also
        typically recommend using virtualenv.
        
        ::
        
            mkdir -p ~/github/cloudmesh
            cd ~/github/cloudmesh
            git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/gitissues.git
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            python setup.py install
        
        Customization
        -------------
        
        In `cloudmesh_gitissues/settings.py` change the list of repositories that
        you like to include::
        
            REPOSITORIES = [
                ("Client", "cloudmesh", "client"),
                ("Portal", "cloudmesh", "portal"),
                ("Workflow", "cloudmesh", "workflow"),
                ("Yubikey", "cloudmesh", "yubikey"),
                ("Big Data Stack", "futuresystems" "big-data-stack"),
                ]
        
        Each entry has the form::
        
            (Label, git_username, git_repository)
        
        For example the entry for::
        
            https://github.com/cloudmesh/client
        
        is::
        
            ("Client", "cloudmesh", "client")
        
        A menu entry will be created for each repository with the given label.
        
        Run portal
        -----------
        
        make run
        
        View portal 
        -------------
        
        make view
        
        Bugs and enhancement suggestion
        --------------------------------
        
        * We should be able to modify the priorities in the table, and have
          a save button that than updates all issues (anyone wants to help?)
