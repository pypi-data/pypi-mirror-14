  Gonzalez]

0.0.26 (2014-02-04)
-------------------

- Logging improvements. Closes #9. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  With the customized logging output for parallel runs, it is now possible to export all logs to disk. It will log to a timestamped directory for each parallel run.

  The logging format for disk is:

      [IS0-8601 DATE] LEVEL   message

  While the logging format for stdout is:

      [HOST] [IS0-8601 DATE] LEVEL   message

  The reason they are different is because the files themselves contain the hostname, so there is no need to prepend it. Stdout/Stderr will also use colors in output, whereas this is omitted in the logfiles for clarity.

  Note that chef_solo_cup will attempt to create all missing directories.

- Add missing import. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

0.0.18 (2013-11-09)
-------------------

- Enable the .json extension on asg dna files. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Enable configuring of asg dna path. Closes #10. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

0.0.17 (2013-11-09)
-------------------

- Retrieve configuration from alternative sources. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

0.0.16 (2013-11-08)
-------------------

- Add the ability to version autoscale groups. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  If you have the following autoscale group:

      app_www-12_04

  And the following dna file:

      dna/asg/app_www-12_04

  And you wish to roll over to a new autoscale group named:

      app_www-12_04-v001

  Then rather than make you create new dna files/whatever, you can simply run chef-solo-cup against the new autoscale group and it will automatically pick up the existing dna file.

  This also makes it simple to do something like:

      # new asg node on a new version of the os
      app_www-12_04 => app_www-14_04

  and use the following dna file:

      dna/asg/app_www

  Notes:

  - Logic goes: Match if exact, else match by substring, else just use the autoscale group name.
  - this is a very naive string match, so if multiple things match, you'll be SOL. Don't do that


0.0.15 (2013-10-16)
-------------------

- Add the ability to limit hosts to a number. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

0.0.14 (2013-10-06)

-------------------

- Fix cleans at the end of bootstrap. Closes #8. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

- Asg: Handle empty autoscaling groups. [Philip Cristiano]

  If the group was empty it would cause a search for instance_id = [] which would match all hosts. Now if the hosts in the ASG are empty it will skip the group.

0.0.12 (2013-06-27)
-------------------

- Catch EC2ResponseError. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

0.0.11 (2013-06-17)
