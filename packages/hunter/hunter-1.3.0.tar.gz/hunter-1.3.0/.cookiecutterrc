    project_short_description: Hunter is a flexible code tracing toolkit, not for
        measuring coverage, but for debugging, logging, inspection and other nefarious
        purposes. It has a simple Python API and a convenient terminal API (see `Environment
        variable activation <env-var-activation_>`_).
