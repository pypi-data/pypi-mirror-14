    Input --
    signals:
        An iterable (e.g. list) of complex numbers. A numpy array should
        work too. The list must have <= MAX_DATA_POINTS elements.

    nsv_sought:
        The number of singular values sought. The function will return a
        maximum of this many singular values.

        Must be <= MAX_SINGULAR_VALUES.

    dwell_time:
        Dwell time in milliseconds

    libhlsvd:
        None (the default) or a string.
        If None, this function will try to find the library on its own.
        If a string, it should be a file name (fully qualified or not,
        e.g. "hlsvd.dll" or "/home/philip/lib/libhlsvd.dylib") that
        this function can pass to ctypes.CDLL().

    Output is a 6-tuple of --
     0) nsv_found: the number of singular values found (<= nsv_sought)
     1) A list of floats representing the singular values
     2) A list of floats representing the frequencies (in kilohertz)
     3) A list of floats representing the damping factors (in milliseconds?)
     4) A list of floats representing the amplitudes (in arbitrary units)
     5) A list of floats representing the phases (in degrees)

    Each list's length == nsv_found. The five lists are correlated (element N
    of one list is associated with element N in the other four lists) and are
    sorted by singular value with the largest (strongest signal) first.

    The frequencies and damping factors have been adjusted by the dwell time.
