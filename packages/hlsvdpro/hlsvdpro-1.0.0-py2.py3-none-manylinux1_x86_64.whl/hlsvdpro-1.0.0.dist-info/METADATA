Summary: This is a Python wrapper around the HLSVDPRO function/library.

This function fits time domain data to a model function that is a set of
lorentzian decaying sinusoids using the state space approach. The original SVD
Fortran code for this was written by Rasmus Munk Larsen and released as PROPACK
SVD. Teresa Laudadio and Diana Sima adapted it into HLSVDPRO.

Description: The HLSVD function fits of a model function (sum of lorentzian decaying sinusoids)
        to the provided time-domain data via the state space approach.
        
        The state space approach is described in S.Y. Kung, K.S. Arun and D.V. Bhaskar Rao, J.
        Opt. Soc. Am. 73, 1799 (1983).
        
        The HLSVD software implementation is described in W.W.F. Pijnappel, A. van den Boogaart,
        R. de Beer, D. van Ormondt, J. Magn. Reson. 97, 122 (1992).
        
        The adaptation of the PROPACK library into HLSVD to create the HLSVDPRO algorithm is
        described in T. Laudadio and N. Mastronardi and L. Vanhamme and P. Van Hecke and
        S. Van Huffel, "Improved Lanczos algorithms for blackbox MRS data quantitation",
        Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Volume 157, pages 292-297, 2002
        
        We (the Vespa team) have made some very minor modifications to this version of HLSVDPRO.
        Most importantly, we added Makefiles and a Python wrapper. We are very grateful to
        all of the above scientists for sharing their work and agreeing to release it under a
        BSD license.
