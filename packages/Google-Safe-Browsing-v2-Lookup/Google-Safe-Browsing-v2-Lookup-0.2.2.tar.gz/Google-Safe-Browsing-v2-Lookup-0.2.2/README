Google Safe Browsing v3 Lookup version 0.2
================================

Google Safe Browsing Lookup library for Python.

If you need to check less than 10,000 URLs a day against the Google Safe Browsing v2 API (https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/lookup_guide), you can use the Lookup API (https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/lookup_guide) as a lighter alternative to the more complex API (https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/developers_guide_v3).

You need to get an API key from Google at https://code.google.com/apis/console/

You can install the library from PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Google%20Safe%20Browsing%20v2%20Lookup/

The source code can be found on github at https://github.com/juliensobrier/google-safe-browsing-lookup-python
