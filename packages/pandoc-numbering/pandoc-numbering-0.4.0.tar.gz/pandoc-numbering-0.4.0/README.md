[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/chdemko/pandoc-numbering.png)](http://travis-ci.org/chdemko/pandoc-numbering)

*pandoc-numbering* is a [pandoc] filter for numbering all kinds of things.

Each paragraph ended by a `#` character will be numbered. The text preceding the `#` character is used a as key
to determine the number used as a replacement for the `#` character.

* if it's a new key, a new numbering is started with index 1;
* if it's an existing key, the last number is incremented.

You can add an identifier to the `#` character. It does not change the behavior explained above. It allows to be cross-referred
in links:

* `[](#identifier "title")` the empty text is replaced by the associated key concatenated with the associated number;
* `[text](#identifier "title")` the `#` character is replaced by the associated number in the text.

In both cases, the `#` character is replaced by the associated number in the title.

You can add a sequence of '#.' character before the last '#' character. In this sequence the '#' characters are replaced by the
numbering of the current headers.

other formats.

Exercise (This is the second exercise) #exercise:second

Use [_theorem #_](#theorem:first)

This version of pandoc-numbering was tested using pandoc 1.15.1 and pandoc 1.16 and is known to work under linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Usage
-----

To apply the filter, use the following option with pandoc:

    --filter pandoc-numbering

Installation
------------

pandoc-numbering requires [python], a programming language that comes pre-installed on linux and Mac OS X, and which is easily installed [on Windows].  Either python 2.7 or 3.x will do.

Install pandoc-numbering as root using the bash command

    pip install pandoc-numbering 

To upgrade to the most recent release, use

    pip install --upgrade pandoc-numbering 

`pip` is a script that downloads and installs modules from the Python Package Index, [PyPI].  It should come installed with your python distribution.  If you are running linux, `pip` may be bundled separately. On a Debian-based system (including Ubuntu), you can install it as root using

    apt-get update
    apt-get install python-pip
