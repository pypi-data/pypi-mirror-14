        *pandoc-numbering* is a `pandoc <http://pandoc.org/>`__ filter for
        numbering all kinds of things.
        
        Each paragraph ended by a ``#`` character will be numbered. The text
        preceding the ``#`` character is used a as key to determine the number
        used as a replacement for the ``#`` character.
        
        -  if it's a new key, a new numbering is started with index 1;
        -  if it's an existing key, the last number is incremented.
        
        You can add an identifier to the ``#`` character. It does not change the
        behavior explained above. It allows to be cross-referred in links:
        
        -  ``[](#identifier "title")`` the empty text is replaced by the
           associated key concatenated with the associated number;
        -  ``[text](#identifier "title")`` the ``#`` character is replaced by
           the associated number in the text.
        
        In both cases, the ``#`` character is replaced by the associated number
        in the title.
        
        You can add a sequence of '#.' characters before the last '#' character.
        In this sequence, the '#' characters are replaced by the numbering of
        the current headers.
        
        If you want to hide the numbering of the headers, you can replace the
        beginning of the '#.' sequence by a '\_.' sequence.
        
        Demonstration: Using
        `pandoc-numbering-sample.md <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chdemko/pandoc-numbering/master/pandoc-numbering-sample.md>`__
        as input gives output files in [pdf], [tex], [html], [epub], [md] and
        other formats.

        This version of pandoc-numbering was tested using pandoc 1.15.1 and
        pandoc 1.16 and is known to work under linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To apply the filter, use the following option with pandoc:
        
        ::
        
            --filter pandoc-numbering
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        pandoc-numbering requires `python <https://www.python.org/>`__, a
        programming language that comes pre-installed on linux and Mac OS X, and
        which is easily installed `on
        Windows <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`__. Either python
        2.7 or 3.x will do.
        
        Install pandoc-numbering as root using the bash command
        
        ::
        
            pip install pandoc-numbering 
        
        To upgrade to the most recent release, use
        
        ::
        
            pip install --upgrade pandoc-numbering 
        
        ``pip`` is a script that downloads and installs modules from the Python
        Package Index, `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__. It should come
        installed with your python distribution. If you are running linux,
        ``pip`` may be bundled separately. On a Debian-based system (including
        Ubuntu), you can install it as root using
        
        ::
        
            apt-get update
            apt-get install python-pip
