# Î»ambdify - feel yourself like an AWS Lambda God
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/lambdify.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/lambdify)

**lambdify** is a tool that turns any python callable into an AWS Lambda function. Create, update and call your lambdas **directly from python**. 

Just like that:

install *lambdify*...
```bash
$pip install lambdify
```
...create AWS Lambda with 4 lines of code:
```python
from lambdify import Lambda


@Lambda.f(name='echo')
def echo(*args, **kwargs):
    return args, kwargs

echo.create()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import getpass
    echo(msg='Hello, {user}!'.format(user=getpass.getuser()))
```

Now you can head over to your [AWS Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and behold your **echo** function.
Could creating a serverless program be any easier?

# The goal
Lambdify aims to unite convenient task queues API (i.e. [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/), [Hue](http://huey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#huey-s-api), [RQ's @job decorator](http://python-rq.org/docs/)) with AWS Lambda service coolest features. Ultimately, **lambdify** should be capable to become a good alternative to Celery or any other task queue.

At present, there are some solutions, that allow you to create and deploy lambdas, like [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa), [lambda-uploader](https://github.com/rackerlabs/lambda-uploader), [lambder](https://github.com/LeafSoftware/python-lambder) etc., but they still have limitations of not being able to interact directly with a python program. 
lambdify overcomes such limitations by using the following algorithm:

1. Serialize the callable with it's globals using [dill](https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill)

2. Upload the ```.lambda.dump``` file containing the serialized function along with the rest of the package

3. Special ```container.py``` module will look for the ```.lambda.dump``` file and inject deserialized function into it's namespace

4. ????

5. Profit

#Usecases and features

* ***Workerless task queue replacement***

The simpliest task queue ever
```python
@Lambda.f(name='my_job')
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```


* ***Distributed computing***

Lambdas can create and call other lambdas:
```python
@Lambda.f(name='child')
def child_function(x, y):
    return x * y
    
@Lambda.f(name='parent')
def parent_function(y):
    # this will actually call the cloud instance of
    # child_function
    return child_function(2, y)

parent_function(42)
```
* ***Dynamic and realtime lambda-function management***
* ***Multiple lambda-functions management***


***P.S. Lambdify is a POC, and at the time allows your lambda to only use site-packages, all local files won't be packaged, so each user-defined dependency should be contained withing the same file.***

***P.P.S***

```python
contributions != lambdify.WELCOME and contributions == lambdify.NECESSARY
