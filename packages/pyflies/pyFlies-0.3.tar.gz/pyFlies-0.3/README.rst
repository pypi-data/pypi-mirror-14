pyFlies
=======

`pyFlies <http://igordejanovic.github.io/pyFlies/>`_ is a Domain-Specific
Language (DSL) for reaction time experiments modeling. It is meant to be highly
readable and simple to learn.

A code for various run-time platforms can be generated from the experiment
description.  Futhermore, model can be directly interpreted if the run-time
supports pyFlies.

The documentation is available `here <http://igordejanovic.github.io/pyFlies/>`_
