2.0.1
-----
NIST recommends a 96-bits nonce length for performance critical situations but it can be up to 2^64 - 1 bits.
Nonce length is now 328 bits. To make unique nonce, cryptoshop use a concatenation of an incremental counter,
UUIDv4, and a long (to minimize drastically collisions) random part generated by RNG.
This changes make this version incompatible with the first version 2.0.0
