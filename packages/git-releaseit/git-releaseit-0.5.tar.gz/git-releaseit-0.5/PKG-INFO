Description: Git-Releaseit
        ==========
        
        `git-releaseit` adds a git command which will smartly auto-increment git release tags.  It currently only supports tags following the `major.minor` convension.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        You can get started with `git-releaseit` by using PIP:
        
        ```
        pip install git-releaseit
        ```
        
        This can be done in a virtual environment or at the system level.  
        
        From then on, you can tag your new releases with something like:
        ```
        git release major
        ```
        or
        ```
        git release minor
        ```
        where `major` indicates a major release and will increment the major version number and reset the minor, and `minor` indicates a minor release and will increment the minor version number and leave the major version number alone.
        
        The command also supports the `-s` option, which will attempt to sign the tag.
        
        The tags are annotated by default, so a `-a` option is not needed.
