Stay focused on work when you want, and goof off when you don't.
Concentration is a simple console utility to block distracting sites
when you need to focus, while allowing you to easily take timed breaks.
Internally uses /etc/hosts file as the mechanism to block sites.

Installing Concentration
========================

::

    pip3 install concentration

    # Or if pip is already set to use Python 3
    pip install concentration

Using Concentration
===================

To keep focused (blocking distracting sites):

::

    sudo concentration improve

To take a small 5 minute timed break:

::

    sudo concentration break

To take a long 60 minute timed break:

::

    sudo concentration break -m 60

To access all sites:

::

    sudo concentration lose

Configuring Concentration
=========================

You can add more files to the blocked list by putting them in the
following files (new line delimited): - ~/.concentration.distractors -
/etc/concentration.distractors

You can make sure sites are visible even if concentration is enabled by
putting them in the following files (new line delimited): -
~/.concentration.safe - /etc/concentration.safe

--------------

Thanks and I hope you find concentration useful in your effort to get
more done!
