Dask
====

Dask is a simple task scheduling system that uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
of tasks to break up large computations into many small ones.

**Dask enables parallel computing** through task scheduling and blocked algorithms.
This allows developers to write complex parallel algorithms and execute them
in parallel either on a modern multi-core machine or on a distributed cluster.

On a single machine dask increases the scale of comfortable data from
*fits-in-memory* to *fits-on-disk* by intelligently streaming data from disk
and by leveraging all the cores of a modern CPU.

Dask use cases
==============

* Dask powers parallel array libraries in climate science (`xarray`_), image
  processing (`scikit-image`_) , and genomics (`scikit-allel`_).
* Dask enables data scientists to process tens of gigabytes of data on a laptop
  using familiar NumPy and Pandas interfaces.
* Dask enables researchers to rapidly prototype and deploy novel algorithms on a
  single machine or a distributed cluster.

Dask user intro
===============

Users interact with dask either by making graphs directly, or through the
*dask collections* which provide larger-than-memory counterparts to existing
popular libraries:

* ``dask.array`` = ``numpy`` + ``threading``
* ``dask.bag`` = ``map, filter, toolz`` + ``multiprocessing``
* ``dask.dataframe`` = ``pandas`` + ``threading``

Dask primarily targets parallel computations that run on a single machine. It
integrates nicely with the existing PyData ecosystem and is trivial to setup
and use::

    conda install dask
    or
    pip install dask

Operations on dask collections (array, bag, dataframe) produce task graphs that
encode blocked algorithms. Task schedulers execute these task graphs in
parallel in a variety of contexts.

**Collections**

Dask collections are the main interaction point for users. They look like
NumPy and pandas but generate dask graphs internally. If you are a dask *user*
then you should start here.

* :doc:`array`
* :doc:`bag`
* :doc:`dataframe`
* :doc:`imperative`

   :hidden:
   :caption: Collections

   bag.rst
   dataframe.rst

**Graphs**

Dask graphs encode algorithms in a simple format involving Python dicts,
tuples, and functions.  This graph format can be used in isolation from the
dask collections.  Working directly with dask graphs is an excellent way to
implement and test new algorithms in fields such as linear algebra,
optimization, and machine learning.  If you are a *developer*, you should start
here.

* :doc:`graphs`
* :doc:`spec`
* :doc:`custom-graphs`
* :doc:`optimize`

**Scheduling**

Schedulers execute task graphs.  After a collection produces a graph we execute
this graph in parallel, either using all of the cores on a single workstation
or using a distributed cluster.

**Inspecting and Diagnosing Graphs**

Parallel code can be tricky to debug and profile. Dask provides a few tools to
help make debugging and profiling graph execution easier.
