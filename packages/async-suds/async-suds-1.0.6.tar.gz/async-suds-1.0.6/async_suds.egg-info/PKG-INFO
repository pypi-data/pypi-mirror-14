Description: 
        ---------------------------------------
        Lightweight SOAP client (Kamyar's fork).
        ---------------------------------------
        
          Based on the original 'suds' project by Jeff Ortel (jortel at redhat
        dot com) hosted at 'http://fedorahosted.org/suds'.
        
          'Suds' is a lightweight SOAP-based web service client for Python
        licensed under LGPL (see the LICENSE.txt file included in the
        distribution).
        
          This is hopefully just a temporary fork of the original suds Python
        library project created because the original project development seems
        to have stalled. Should be reintegrated back into the original project
        if it ever gets revived again.
