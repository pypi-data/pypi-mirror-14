Description: What is VUnit?
        ==============
        
        VUnit is an open source unit testing framework for VHDL/SystemVerilog
        released under the terms of Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. It
        features the functionality needed to realize continuous and automated
        testing of your HDL code. VUnit doesn't replace but rather complements
        traditional testing methodologies by supporting a "test early and
        often" approach through automation.
