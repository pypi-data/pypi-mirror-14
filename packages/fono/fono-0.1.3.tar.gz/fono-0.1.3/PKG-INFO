        Environment
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The below will create a python environment called ``fono-env``. If you
        want a different environment name, open ``environment.yml`` and change
        the first line
        
        Open a terminal and run the following
        
        ::
        
            cd ~/GitRepos/fono # Or change directory to the root of the folder
            conda env create -f environment.yml
        
        Run
        ---
        
        Activate the environment
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        -  Open a terminal, and change directory to the root of the folder
        -  Run the following to activate an environment
        
           ::
        
               source activate fono-env
        
        -  Run the following to find the optimal order using input in a folder
        
           ::
        
               python fono/run.py --folder fono/data
        
        OR
        
        -  Run the following to find the optimal order using input from
           individual files
        
           ::
        
               python fono/run.py --quantity fono/data/quantity.csv --price fono/data/price.csv --shipping fono/data/shipping.csv
        
        Three files are required to find the optimal order
        
        -  prices.csv
        -  quantity.csv
        -  shipping.csv
        
        Prices contains the price of an item when purchased from a website.
        
        Quantity contains the number of items required.
        
        Shipping contains the shipping cost from the individual websites.
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        -  Names of items in quantity.csv has to match prices.csv
        -  Names of websites in shipping.csv has to match prices.csv
        -  Remove all empty lines
