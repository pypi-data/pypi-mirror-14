        Three files are required to find the optimal order
        
        -  prices.csv
        -  quantity.csv
        -  shipping.csv
        
        Prices contains the price of an item when purchased from a website.
        
        Quantity contains the number of items required.
        
        Shipping contains the shipping cost from the individual websites.
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        -  Names of items in quantity.csv has to match prices.csv
        -  Names of websites in shipping.csv has to match prices.csv
        -  Remove all empty lines
