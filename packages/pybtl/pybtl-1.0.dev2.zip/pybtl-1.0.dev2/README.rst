pybtl
=====

Bitloads, or bit payloads, are compact payloads containing binary
representations of data. It's a generic binary serialization format for Python
objects.

The pybtl uses a declarative syntax for describing conversion of python
objects into bitloads and vice versa, and provides the tools for performing the
conversions. The name of the library has also been shotened to reflect its
purpose. :)

Full documentation is available `on Readthedocs
