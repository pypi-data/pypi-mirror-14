Description: pybtl
        =====
        
        Bitloads, or bit payloads, are compact payloads containing binary
        representations of data. It's a generic binary serialization format for Python
        objects.
        
        The pybtl uses a declarative syntax for describing conversion of python
        objects into bitloads and vice versa, and provides the tools for performing the
        conversions. The name of the library has also been shotened to reflect its
        purpose. :)
