Description: Git-Repo: git services CLI utility
        ----------------------------------
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        Control your remote git hosting services from the ``git`` commandline.
        The usage is very simple. To clone a new project, out of github, just
        issue:
        
        ::
        
            % git-repo hub clone guyzmo/git-repo
        
        But that works also with a project from gitlab, bitbucket, or your own
        gitlab:
        
        ::
        
            % git-repo lab clone guyzmo/git-repo
            % git-repo bb clone guyzmo/git-repo
            % git-repo myprecious clone guyzmo/git-repo
        
        If you want to can choose the default branch to clone:
        
        ::
        
            % git-repo lab clone guyzmo/git-repo master
        
        Though sometimes, as you're starting a new project, you want to create a
        new repository to push to:
        
        ::
        
            % git-repo hub create guyzmo/git-repo
        
        actually the namespace is facultative, as per default you can (and want
        to) only create new repositories within your own account.
        
        You might also want to add an existing remote ref to your workspace, and
        that can be easily done with:
        
        ::
        
            % git-repo lab add guyzmo/git-repo
        
        Which will add ``https://gitlab.com/guyzmo/git-repo`` as the ``gitlab``
        remote!
        
        Finally, you can open the repository's page, using the ``open`` command:
        
        ::
        
            % git-repo lab open guyzmo/git-repo
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can get the tool using pypi:
        
        ::
        
            % pip install git-repo
        
        or by getting the sources and running:
        
        ::
        
            % python3 setup.py install
        
        Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To configure ``git-repo`` you need to tweak your ``~/.gitconfig``. For
        each service you've got an account on, you have to make a section in the
        gitconfig:
        
        ::
        
            [gitrepo "gitlab"]
                private-key = YourVerySecretKey
        
            [gitrepo "github"]
                private-key = YourOtherVerySecretKey
        
            [gitrepo "bitbucket"]
                private-key = username:password
        
        Here, we're setting the basics: just the private key. You'll notice that
        for bitbucket the private key is your username and password seperated by
        a column. That's because bitbucket does not offer throw away private
        keys for tools (I might implement BB's OAuth at some point).
        
        You also have the ability to set up an alias:
        
        ::
        
            [gitrepo "bitbucket"]
                alias = bit
                private-key = username:password
        
        that will change the command you use for a name you'll prefer to handle
        actions for the service you use:
        
        ::
        
            % git-repo bit clone guyzmo/git-repo
        
        Also, you can setup your own gitlab self-hosted server, using that
        configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [gitrepo "myprecious"]
                type = gitlab
                private-key = YourSuperPrivateKey
                url = https://gitlab.example.org/
        
        Finally, to make it really cool, you can make a few aliases in your
        gitconfig:
        
        ::
        
            [alias]
                hub = repo hub
                lab = repo lab
                bb = repo bb
                perso = repo perso
        
        So you can run the tool as a git subcommand:
        
        ::
        
            git hub clone guyzmo/git-repo
        
        TODO
        ~~~~
        
        -  [ ] make it possible to choose method (SSH or HTTPS)
        -  [ ] make a ``git-repo fork`` action that will:
        
           -  make a fork on the remote repository
           -  clone the fork locally
           -  add both the fork and the forked as remotes
        
        -  [ ] add OAuth support for bitbucket
        -  for more features, write an issue or, even better, a PR!
