PyNOMAD Change Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--------------------
v0.1.7-1, 2016-03-23
--------------------

- added optional epoch for applying proper motions in nomad.read_one_catalog_file, which fixes a problem with the formatting of the output

------------------
v0.1.7, 2016-03-23
------------------

- added function to read in one whole catalog file (nomad.read_one_catalog_file), which can be useful when creating subsets of the whole catalog (e.g. every star within a narrow color range across whole sky)

------------------
v0.1.6, 2015-07-10
------------------

- made finding the nomad database dir more robust & able to find on other volumes (if not buried)
- removed SkyCoord functionality because performance was unacceptable (adding a SkyCoord object column to pandas DataFrame was incredibly slow no matter when/how the column was created, even at initial Dataframe creation)

------------------
v0.1.6dev, 2015-05-23
------------------

- add add_SkyCoord_field param to queries so that can toggle off if don't need.  The creation of SkyCoord objects is relatively slow.  (Biggest issue is that adding a column to a Pandas DataFrame is quite slow.)
- tried to change how the pandas DataFrame is created to address speed issues when SkyCoord column is included, but failed and stripped out the SkyCoord code
- made finding the nomad database dir more robust & able to find on other volumes (if not buried)
- fixed a few bugs with paths if _nomad_dir isn't given a trailing '/'.  

------------------
v0.1.5, 2015-05-23
------------------

- include proper motion values in output dataframes (useful for making starlists for some observatories where they will calculate the proper motion for the specific date)

------------------
v0.1.4, 2015-05-23
------------------

- huge speed-up by moving where 'radec' SkyCoord field is added (now doing after winnowing of stars)

------------------
v0.1.3, 2015-05-23
------------------

- output DataFrame now has 'radec' field that is of type astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord
- added astropy>=1.0.0 dependency

------------------
v0.1.2, 2015-05-22
------------------

- bumped up pandas version requirement because of usage of df.loc[]

------------------
v0.1.1, 2015-05-22
------------------

- reorganize project to current way I organize projects

------------------
v0.1.0, 2013-09-06
------------------

- Initial release.
