Summary: Gradually reduce redis maxmemory.REDIS (redis.io) will block while ensuring maxmemory is honored, so when reducing it significantlyit is helpful to do so over a period of time in smaller steps if necessary.  For example an AWS EC2m2.2xlarge instance takes in the vicinity of 1-5 seconds to evict 256MB of keys.
