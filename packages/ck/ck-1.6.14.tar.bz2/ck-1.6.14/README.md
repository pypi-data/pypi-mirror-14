Are you an individual researcher or organization performing
many experiments on a regular basis? You may find the Collective 
Knowledge framework (CK) useful if you suffer from one or
more of the following problems:

* instead of innovating, you spend weeks and months preparing 
ad-hoc experimental workflows, which you either throw away 
when your ideas are not validated or need to maintain
(adapting to ever changing software, hardware, interfaces and
data formats);

* you have trouble sharing whole experimental workflows 
and results with your colleagues since they use different
operating systems, tools, libraries and hardware
(and they do need to use their latest environment rather 
than possibly outdated Docker or VM images);

* you have trouble managing and reusing your own scripts, tools, 
data sets and reproducing your own results from past projects;

* you have trouble retrieving data from your own or someone else's
"black-box" database (particularly if you do not know the schema);

* you spend lots of time updating your reports and papers whenever
you obtain new results;

* you do not have enough realistic workloads, benchmarks and data sets
for your research;

* you face the ever increasing number of experimental choices
to explore in complex design and optimization spaces;

* you accumulate vast amounts of raw experimental data but do not
know what the data is telling you ("big data" problem);

* you want to extract knowledge from raw data in form of models
but never find time to master powerful predictive analytics techniques;

* your organization pays dearly for its computational needs
(in particular, for hardware and energy used in data
centers and supercomputers) while you suspect they could
be met at a fraction of the cost (if, for example, your
deep learning algorithms could run 10 times faster).

Over the past 15 years, we have suffered from all the above
problems, which intolerably slowed down our own research
(on developing faster, smaller, more energy efficient and
reliable computer systems via multi-objective autotuning,
machine learning and run-time adaptation). 
Eventually, we have realized that the above problems 
can only be tackled collaboratively by bringing together
an interdisciplinary community.

Hence, we designed Collective Knowledge (CK) as 
just a small and highly customizable Python wrapper
framework with a unified JSON API, command line, web
services and meta-descriptions. This allows researchers 
gradually warp and glue together any existing software, 
hardware and data, share and reuse wrappers via Git, 
unify information flow between them, quickly prototype 
experimental workflows from shared artifacts, 
apply predictive analytics and enable interactive articles.

CK is an open-source (under permissive license),
lightweight (< 1 MB) and very portable research SDK. It has
minimal dependencies and simple interfaces with software
written in C, C++, Fortran, Java, PHP and other languages.
Please, check out CK documentation and Getting Started
Guide for more details: http://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki

Though seemingly simple, such agile approach already proved
to be powerful enough to help scientists and research engineers:

* abstract and unify access to their software, hardware and data 
via CK modules (wrappers) with a simple JSON API 
while protecting users from continuous low-level changes
and exposing only minimal information needed for research
and experimentation (this, in turn, enables simple 
co-existence of multiple tools and libraries such as 
different versions of compilers including LLVM, GCC and ICC);

* provide a simple and user-friendly directory structure 
(CK repositories) to gradually convert all local artifacts 
(scripts, benchmarks, data sets, tools, results, predictive models, 
graphs, articles) into searchable, reusable and interconnected 
CK entries (components) with unique IDs and open JSON-based meta 
information while getting rid of all hardwired paths;

* quickly prototype research ideas from shared components
as LEGO(TM), unify exchange of results in schema-free JSON
format and focus on knowledge discovery (only when idea
is validated you should spend extra time on adding proper
types, descriptions and tests, and not vice versa);

* easily share CK repositories with whole experimental
setups and templates with the community via popular public
services including GitHub and BitBucket while keeping track
of all development history;

* speed up search across all your local artifacts by JSON
meta information using popular ElasticSearch (optional);

* involve the community or workgroups to share realistic
workloads, benchmarks, data sets, tools, predictive models 
and features in a unified and customizable format;

* reproduce empirical experimental results in a different environment 
and under different conditions, and apply statistical analysis 
(similar to physics) rather than just replicating them 
- useful to analyze and validate varying results
(such as performance and energy);

* use built-in CK web server to view interactive graphs
and articles while easily crowdsourcing experiments 
using spare computational resources (mobile devices, data centers,
supercomputers) and reporting back unexpected behavior; 

* obtain help from an interdisciplinary community to explain 
unexpected behavior when reproducing experiments, solve it 
by improving related CK modules and entries, and immediately 
push changes back to the community (similar to Wikipedia);

* simplify the use of statistical analysis and predictive
analytics techniques for non-specialists via CK modules
and help you process large amount of experimental results
(possibly on the fly via active learning), share and
improve predictive models and features (knowledge), and
effectively compact "big data".

For example, our colleagues successfully use CK to
accelerate computer systems' research and tackle issues
known and unsolved for more than 15 years. They started
practically enabling customizable, extensible and
multi-objective software/hardware optimization, run-time
adaptation and co-design as a CK experimental workflow
shared via GitHub. The community can now gradually expose
various tuning choices (algorithm and OpenCL/CUDA/MPI
parameters, compiler flags, polyhedral transformations,
CPU/GPU frequency, etc) and objectives (execution time,
code size, compilation time, energy, processors size,
accuracy, reliability) . The community can also reuse
shared autotuning and machine learning plugins to speed
up exploration of large and non-linear optimization spaces
and even enable run-time adaptation (self-tuning computer
systems).

For example, check out public GCC/LLVM optimization results 
of various shared workloads across  diverse hardware including
mobile devices provided by volunteers:
* http://cTuning.org/crowd-results
* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=openscience.crowdsource.experiments

Furthermore, our colleagues have managed to speed up their real-world
applications across latest platforms
(from mobile phones to cloud servers) by 10x with the same
numerical accuracy, reduce energy by 30% and code size
by 50%. Furthermore, such CK templates can be easily reused
in other research scenarios while allowing students and
researchers start new experiments or reproduce others' results
in minutes rather than days and weeks, as described here:

Our long-term mission is to help the research community
dramatically accelerate knowledge discovery via open,
agile, collaborative and reproducible research,
experimentation and knowledge sharing while keeping it as
simple as GitHub and Wikipedia - do join us!

Minimal requirements
====================
* Python >= 2.6 (3.0+ is natively supported)
* GIT command line client

If you would like to use shared repositories with already implemented
crowd-benchmarking, multi-objective autotuning, statistical analysis,
predictive analytics, interactive graphs, etc, you may need to install
extra Python packages: 

* 'matplotlib','scipy' and 'numpy' to plot graphs and perform statistical 
analysis (during performance/energy/accuracy autotuning and modeling)
* 'sklearn-kit' for predictive analytics
* 'psutil' to properly terminate running process on Windows after timeout 
(during program autotuning and design space exploration)
* 'Tkinter' or 'tkinter' or 'pyperclip' if copy to clipboard functionality 
is required (to reproduce CK experiments from the web)

Alternatively, you can use Anaconda python distribution
which includes all scientific packages required for CK-based
collaborative and reproducible experimentation.

You can also considerably speed up local search by installing 
free third-party Hadoop-based ElasticSearch (http://elastic.co) 
and turning on transparent indexing in CK.

We successfully validated CK on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X 
and partially on Android.

Minimal installation
====================

Download latest CK from GitHub:

 $ git clone https://github.com/ctuning/ck.git ck

Add ck/bin directory to PATH variable

 $ export PATH=$PWD/ck/bin:$PATH

On Windows, you should manually add full path to ck/bin 
to you PATH environment variable.

If you would like to use CK from ipython notebook or other
python applications, you can install it as a standard 
Python library (you may need root privileges depending 
on how your Python is installed):

 $ cd ck

 $ sudo python setup.py install
    and/or
 $ sudo python3 setup.py install

By default, CK attempts to find and use the latest version of installed Python, 
i.e. v3 and only then v2. However, this may cause ambiguities with above 
installation. If you get an error "no module named ck.kernel", you can
force CK to use a specific Python version by changing environment 
variable "CK_PYTHON", i.e.:

 $ export CK_PYTHON=python3
 
 or

 $ export CK_PYTHON=python

Other installation possibilities (via PIP, Conda, Debian) are described
here: https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Installation 

Basic usage
===========

You can check that CK is installed correctly via:

 $ ck

You should see information about CK options.

If you have IPython installed, you can then check CK library 
installation as following:

 $ ipython

 $ import ck.kernel as ck

 $ ck.test()

 $ ck.access('list module')

 $ ck.access('load kernel default')

Now, you can use CK to pull various shared CK repositories
(code and data shared as reusable components via GitHub
or Bitbucket) and run shared experimental workflows.

For example, we use CK to systematize and accelerate our computer systems' 
research, perform systematic benchmarking across any existing hardware, 
crowdsource multi-objective program optimization, share realistic workloads, 
build predictive models of performance, analyze representative benchmarks 
and data sets, install missing tools, etc. Rather than wasting weeks and
months developing your own ad-hoc experimental setups, you can now obtain,
compile and run any shared benchmark on your Linux machine with GCC 
in less than a minute via:

 $ ck pull repo:ctuning-programs

 $ ck compile program:cbench-automotive-susan --speed

 $ ck run program:cbench-automotive-susan

You will be asked a few questions and for now you can just press Enter 
to select the default choices.

Please refer to CK documentation (https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki)
to find out how to compile and run such benchmarks on Windows or Android,
autotune or crowdtune them (performance, energy, accuracy, size, etc),
share other realistic workloads, benchmarks and data sets, apply machine 
learning to explain unexpected behavior or predict optimizations, 
and quickly prototype your own research ideas.

CK also helps you get rid of hardwired paths for your local data sets,
tools and scripts - instead you can simply query CK and obtain all 
shared data sets by specific tags simply via

 $ ck search dataset --tags=image,jpeg

 $ ck find dataset:[name from above list]

You can also easily add your own CK modules to serve
as wrappers (containers) with unified API for your data and
tools while gradually substituting all your ad-hoc scripts.
For example, you can add your own module 'hello' with
an action 'say' and with an entry 'world' as following (you
can select all default values by just pressing Enter):

 $ ck add module:hello

 $ ck add_action module --func=say

 $ ck add hello:world

 $ ck say hello:world

You can now find and customize Python dummy function 'say' 
in the CK module 'hello' (module.py) via
 
 $ ck find module:hello

You can also find associated CK entry hello:say and modify 
its meta information (.cm/meta.json) via

 $ ck find hello:world

Finally, you can start CK web server either to be able
to collect experimental results from other users or to
browse your local artifacts (including interactive graphs
and articles) in a user-friendly way:

 $ ck start web

 $ open browser with URL http://localhost:3344

Please, check out CK documentation (including Getting Started Guide 
and various tutorials) for more details:

* https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki

Participating in experiment crowdsourcing
=========================================
You can easily partipcate in collaborative program optimization and 
machine learning using the following two steps:

 $ ck pull repo:ck-crowdtuning
 
 $ ck crowtune program

All public optimization results are available at http://cTuning.org/crowd-results
