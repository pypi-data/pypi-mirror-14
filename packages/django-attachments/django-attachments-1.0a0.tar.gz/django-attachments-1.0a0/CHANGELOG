Changelog:
==========

v0.3.1 (2009-07-29):

    * Added a note to the README that you should secure your static files.

v0.3 (2009-07-22):

    * This version adds more granular control about user permissons. You need
      to explicitly add permissions to users who should been able to upload,
      delete or delete foreign attachments.

      This might be **backwards incompatible** as you did not need to assign
      add/delete permissions before!
