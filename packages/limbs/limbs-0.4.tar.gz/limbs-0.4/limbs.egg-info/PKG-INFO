Version: 0.4
Summary: like mime, but simpler - a simple, human-readable file format

Simple I/O to flat text files with a header (composed of fields) and a body (arbitrary bytes).
Ideal for no-hassle storage of some metadata and some large data that doesn't fit nicely into
things like JSON (which becomes really hard to edit in a text editor if there's a 2 MB blob of
numbers somewhere in it).
