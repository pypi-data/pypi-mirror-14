======

    /kĭf kĭf/

QIF is a format widely used by personal money management software such as
`GnuCash`_ to import information. Yet, the import process is particularly
tedious as it require to manually pair the transactions contained in the file
with categories (or "accounts" for double-entry bookkeeping systems).

qifqif augment your qif files by adding a category line for each transaction,
that additional information can then be used by accounting software to perform
automatic QIF imports.
It picks categories by searching for predefined keywords in transactions
descriptions lines and by repeating choices you previously made regarding
similar transactions.

Features
--------

- **Blazing fast edits:** thanks to well-thought-out defaults and ``<TAB>``
  completion
- **Auditing mode:** review your transactions one by one
- **Batch mode (no interactive):** for easy integration with scripts
- **Easy-going workflow:** dreading the behemoth task of importing years of
  accounting from a single file? Don't be. Go at your own pace and press
  ``<Ctrl+C>`` to exit anytime. On next run, editing will resume right where
  you left it.
