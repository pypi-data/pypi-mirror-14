Description: Plone's Specific Implementation of Tiles
        ========================================
        
        ``plone.app.tiles`` is Plone's UI integration for `plone.tiles <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.tiles>`_.

        This package contains the following things:
        
        * A view ``@@add-tile``, and an associated form, which can be used to create a
          new tile based on the tile's schema. For transient tiles, this merely
          redirects to a URL with an appropriate query string. For persistent tiles,
          it will also save the necessary data. This will fire an
          ``IObjectCreatedEvent`` as well as an ``IObjectAddedEvent`` for the newly
          created tile (a transient object) when successfully submitted. In the case
          of the ``IObjectAddedEvent``, the ``newParent`` attribute will be the tile's
          context, and the ``newName`` attribute will be the tile's id.
        
        * The ``@@add-tile`` view, when accessed directly, allows the user to choose
          from all available tiles (subject to the tile's add permission) and
          redirects to the appropriate ``@@add-tile/<tile-type>`` URL to configure the
          tile.
        
        * A view ``@@edit-tile``, and an associated form, which can be used to edit a
          tile based on the tile's schema. This will fire an ``IObjectModifiedEvent``
          for the modified tile (a transient object) when successfully submitted.
        
        * A view ``@@delete-tile``, where the user may select a tile type, enter a tile
          id, and opt to clear out any persistent data for that tile. This can also be
          called by AJAX code given appropriate request parameters. This will fire an
          ``IObjectRemovedEvent`` for the removed tile (a transient object). The
          ``oldParent`` attribute will be the tile's context, and the ``oldName``
          attribute will be the tile's id.
        
        The default add and edit forms should suffice for most use cases. You can use
        `plone.autoform <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.autoform>`_ to configure
        alternative widgets, either by hand or via `plone.directives.form
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.directives.form>`_.
        
        If you need a custom form, you can register an add view as an adapter from
        ``(context, request, tileType)``, where ``tileType`` is an instance providing
        ``plone.tiles.interfaces.ITileType``.
        
        The actual integration of the various views is left up to other packages (such
        as the Deco editor).
