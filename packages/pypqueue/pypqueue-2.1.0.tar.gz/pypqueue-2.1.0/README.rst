The pypqueue package provides a python interface for submitting jobs
to a simple persistent queue backed by the local filesystem. In many
ways, the approach is similar to Maildir.

The persistent queue is described in more detail in the documentation
to `go-pqueue <https://godoc.org/github.com/ljosa/go-pqueue/pqueue>`_.
