**CO2MPAS** is backward-looking longitudinal-dynamics CO\ :sub:`2` and
fuel-consumption simulator for light-duty vehicles (cars and vans),
specially crafted to back-translate consumption figures from WLTP cycles
into NEDC ones.

It is an open-source project developed with Python-3.4,
using Anaconda & WinPython under Windows 7, Anaconda under MacOS, and
Linux's standard python environment.
It runs as a *console command*, with various graphical UIs on the making.

History
=======
The *European Commission* is supporting the introduction of the *WLTP cycle*
for Light-duty vehicles developed at the *United Nations (UNECE)*
level, in the shortest possible time-frame. Its introduction requires
the adaptation of CO\ :sub:`2` certification and monitoring procedures set
by European regulations. European Commission's *Joint Research Centre* has been
assigned the development of this vehicle simulator to facilitate this
adaptation.

For recent activity, check the :doc:`changes`.


Quickstart
==========
.. Tip::
    **About console-commands:**

    - Console-commands beginning with ``$`` symbol are for the ``bash`` shell
      (UNIX).
      You can install it on *Windows* with **cygwin**: https://www.cygwin.com/
      along with these useful utilities::

        * git, git-completion
        * make, zip, unzip, bzip2, 7z, dos2unix
        * openssh, curl, wget

    - Console-commands beginning with ``>`` symbol are for *Windows* ``cmd.exe``
      command-prompt.
      You can augment it with bash-like capabilities using **Clink**:
      http://mridgers.github.io/clink/

    - You can adapt commands between the two shells with minor modifications
      (i.e. ``ls <--> dir``, ``rm -r <--> rmdir /s/q``).

    - You may download and install the *all-in-one* archive which contains
      both shells configured in a console supporting decent copy-paste and
      resizing capabilities (see :ref:`all-in-one`).


IF you have familiarity with v1 release AND IF you already have a full-blown
*python-3 environment* (i.e. *Linux* or the *all-in-one* archive) you can
immediately start working with the following *bash* commands; otherwise
follow the detailed instructions under sections :ref:`install` and
:ref:`usage`.

.. code-block:: console

    ## Install co2mpas.
    ## NOTE: If behind proxy, specify additionally this option:
    ##    --proxy http://user:password@yourProxyUrl:yourProxyPort
    ##
    $ pip install co2mpas

    ## Where to store input and output files.
    ## In *Windows* cmd-prompt use `md` command instead.
    $ mkdir input output

    ## Create a template excel-file for inputs.
    $ co2mpas template input/vehicle_1.xlsx

    ###################################################
    ## Edit generated `./input/vehicle_1.xlsx` file. ##
    ###################################################

    ## Run simulator.
    $ co2mpas batch  input -O output

    ###################################################
    ## Inspect generated results inside `./output/`. ##

.. _install:

Install
=======
The installation procedure has 2-stages:

1. Install (or Upgrade) Python (2 choices under *Windows*).
2. Install CO2MPAS:
    a. Install (or Upgrade) executable.
    b. (optional) Install documents.
    c. (optional) Install sources.

On *Windows* you may alternatively install the *all-In-One* archive
instead of performing the above 2 steps separately.


.. _all-in-one:

*All-In-One* Installation under Windows
---------------------------------------
- Download **all-in-one archive** from
  http://files.co2mpas.io/.
  Ensure that you download the correct 32/64 architecture for your PC
  (the 64bit archive CANNOT run on 32bit PCs, but the opposite is possible).

- Use the original `"7z" extraxtor <http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable>`_,
  since "plain-zip" produces out-of-memory errors when expanding long
  directories.
  Prefer to **extract it in a folder without any spaces in its path.**

- Run ``INSTALL.bat`` script contained in the root of the unzipped folder.
  It will install links for commons CO2MPAS tasks under your *Windows*
  Start-Menu.

- Visit the guidelines for its usage: :doc:`allinone`
  (also contained within the archive).

.. Note::
    If you have downloaded an *all-in-one* from previous version of CO2MPAS
    you may upgrade CO2MPAS contained within.
    Follow the instructions in the "Upgrade" section, below.


Python Installation
-------------------
If you already have a suitable python-3 installation with all scientific
packages updated to their latest versions, you may skip this 1st stage.

.. Note::
    **Installing Python under Windows:**

    The program requires CPython-3, and depends on *numpy*, *scipy*, *pandas*,
    *sklearn* and *matplotlib* packages, which depend on C-native backends
    and need a C-compiler to install from sources.

    In *Windows* it is strongly suggested **NOT to install the standard CPython
    distribution that comes up first(!) when you google for "python windows"**,
    unless you are an experienced python-developer, and you know how to
    hunt down pre-compiled dependencies from the *PyPi* repository and/or
    from the `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages
    <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_.

    Therefore we suggest that you download one of the following two
    *scientific-python* distributions:

      #. `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_ **python-3** (prefer 64 bit)
      #. `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ **python-3** (prefer 64 bit)



Install WinPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *WinPython* distribution is just a collection of the standard pre-compiled
binaries for *Windows* containing all the scientific packages, and much more.
It is not update-able, and has a quasi-regular release-cycle of 3 months.


1. Install the latest python-3 (preferably 64 bit) from https://winpython.github.io/.
   Prefer an **installation-folder without any spaces leading to it**.

2. Open the WinPython's command-prompt console, by locating the folder where
   you just installed it and run (double-click) the following file::

        <winpython-folder>\"WinPython Command Prompt.exe"


3. In the console-window check that you have the correct version of
   WinPython installed, and expect a similar response:

   .. code-block:: console

        > python -V
        Python 3.4.3

        REM Check your python is indeed where you installed it.
        > where python
        ....


4. Use this console and follow :ref:`co2mpas-install` instructions, below.



Install Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *Anaconda* distribution is a non-standard Python environment that
for *Windows* containing all the scientific packages we need, and much more.
It is not update-able, and has a semi-regular release-cycle of 3 months.

1. Install Anaconda python 3.4 (preferably 64 bit) from http://continuum.io/downloads.
   Prefer an **installation-folder without any spaces leading to it**.

   .. Note::
        When asked by the installation wizard, ensure that *Anaconda* gets to be
        registered as the default python-environment for the user's account.

2. Open a *Windows* command-prompt console::

        "windows start button" --> `cmd.exe`

3. In the console-window check that you have the correct version of
   Anaconda-python installed, by typing:

   .. code-block:: console

        > python -V
        Python 3.4.3 :: Anaconda 2.3.0 (64-bit)

        REM Check your python is indeed where you installed it.
        > where python
        ....

4. Use this console and follow :ref:`co2mpas-install` instructions, below.


.. _co2mpas-install:

CO2MPAS installation
--------------------
1. Install CO2MPAS executable internally into your python-environment with
   the following console-command:

   .. code-block:: console

        > pip install co2mpas
        Collecting co2mpas
        Downloading http://pypi.co2mpas.io/packages/co2mpas-...
        ...
        Installing collected packages: co2mpas
        Successfully installed co2mpas-1.1.1.post1

   .. Note::
        **Installing Behind Firewall:**

        This previous step requires http-connectivity to Python's "standard"
        repository (https://pypi.python.org/) and to co2mpas-site
        (http://files.co2mpas.io).
        In case you are behind a **corporate proxy**, you may either:

        a) Append the following option to all ``pip`` commands, appropriately
           adapted: ``--proxy http://user:password@yourProxyUrl:yourProxyPort``.

           To avert any security deliberations for this http-proxy "tunnel",
           JRC *cryptographically signs* all *final releases*, so that you or
           your IT staff may `validate their authenticity
           <https://www.davidfischer.name/2012/05/signing-and-verifying-python-packages-with-pgp/>`_
           and detect *man-in-the-middle* attacks, however impossible.

        b) Download all *wheel* packages from `co2mpas-site
           <http://files.co2mpas.io>`_ for the specific version you are
           interested in , and install them one by one (see next section).

           .. code-block:: console

               REM Download MANUALLY all `*.whl` files contained in release folder
               REM from co2mpas-site in some folder.
               > cd <folder-where-wheels_downloaded>
               > pip install *.whl


   .. Warning::
       If you cannot install CO2MPAS, re-run the ``pip`` command adding
       2 *verbose* flags ``-vv``, copy-paste the console-output, and send it
       to JRC.


2. Check that when you run ``co2mpas``, the version executed is indeed the one
   installed above (check both version-identifiers and paths):

   .. code-block:: console

       > co2mpas -vV
       co2mpas_version: 1.1.1.post1
       co2mpas_rel_date: 2016-03-03 16:49:00
       co2mpas_path: d:\co2mpas_ALLINONE-XXbit-v1.0.5.dev1\Apps\WinPython\python-3.4.3\lib\site-packages\co2mpas
       python_path: D:\co2mpas_ALLINONE-XXbit-v1.0.5.dev1\WinPython\python-3.4.3
       python_version: 3.4.3 (v3.4.3:9b73f1c3e601, Feb 24 2015, 22:44:40) [MSC v.1600 XXX]
       PATH: D:\co2mpas_ALLINONE-XXbit-v1.0.5.dev1\WinPython...


   .. Note::
       The above procedure installs the *latest* CO2MPAS, which
       **might be more up-to-date than the version described here!**

       In that case you can either:

       a) Visit the documents for the newer version actually installed.
       b) "Pin" the exact version you wish to install with a ``pip`` command
          (see section below).


Install extras
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Internally CO2MPAS uses an algorithmic scheduler to execute model functions.
In order to visualize the *design-time models* and *run-time workflows*
you need to install the **Graphviz** visualization library  from:
http://www.graphviz.org/.

If you skip this step, the ``graphplot`` sub-command and the ``--plot-workflow``
option would both fail to run (see :ref:`debug`).



Upgrade CO2MPAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Uninstall (see below) and re-install it.


Uninstall CO2MPAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To uninstall CO2MPAS type the following command, and confirm it with ``y``:

.. code-block:: console

    > pip uninstall co2mpas
    Uninstalling co2mpas-<installed-version>
    ...
    Proceed (y/n)?


Re-run the command *again*, to make sure that no dangling installations are left
over; disregard any errors this time.


Different ways of installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may get multiple versions of CO2MPAS, from various places, but all
require the use of ``pip`` command from a *console* to install:

..  Warning::
    In all cases below, remember to uninstall CO2MPAS if it's already installed.

- **Latest STABLE:**
  use the default ``pip`` described command above.

- **Latest PRE-RELEASE:**
  append the ``--pre`` option in the ``pip`` command.

- **Specific version:**
  modify the ``pip`` command like that, with optionally appending ``--pre``:

  .. code-block:: console

      pip install co2mpas==1.0.1 ... # Other options, like above.

- **Specific branch** from the GitHub-sources:

  .. code-block:: console

      pip install git+https://github.com/JRCSTU/co2mpas.git@dev

- **Specific commit** from the GitHub-sources:

  .. code-block:: console

      pip install git+https://github.com/JRCSTU/co2mpas.git@2927346f4c513a

- When you are **behind an http-proxy** (for all of the above):
  append an appropriately adapted option
  ``--proxy http://user:password@yourProxyUrl:yourProxyPort``.

- **Without internet connectivity** (for all of the above):

  1. Pre-download locally all files in the ``packages`` folder located in
     the desired CO2MPAS version at `CO2MPAS site <http://files.co2mpas.io/>`_,
     with "normal" browser.  Lets assume that you downloaded the packages in
     the folder ``co2mpas_packages``.
  2. Install them with a console-command like that:

  .. code-block:: console

      pip install co2mpas -f path/to/co2mpas_packages


Install Multiple versions in parallel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to run and compare results from different CO2MPAS versions,
you may use `virtualenv <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_
command.

The `virtualenv` command creates isolated python-environments ("children-venvs")
where in each one you can install a different versions of CO2MPAS.

.. Note::
    The `virtualenv` command does NOT run under the "conda" python-environment.
    Use the `conda command <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html>`_
    in similar manner to create child *conda-environments* instead.


1. Ensure `virtualenv` command installed in your "parent" python-environment,
   i.e the "WinPython" you use:

   .. code-block:: console

       > pip install virtualenv

   .. Note::
      The `pip` command above has to run only once for each parent python-env.
      If `virtualenv` is already installed, `pip` will exit gracefully.



2. Ensure co2mpas uninstalled in your parent-env:

   .. code-block:: console

       > pip uninstall co2mpas

   .. Warning::
     It is important for the "parent" python-env NOT to have CO2MPAS installed!
     The reasone is that you must set "children venvs" to inherit all packages
     installed on their "parent" (i.e. `numpy` and `pandas`), and you cannot
     update any inherited package from within a child-env.


3. Move to the folder where you want your "venvs" to reside and create
   the "venv" with this command:

   .. code-block:: console

       > virtualenv --system-site-packages co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv.venv

   The ``--system-site-packages`` option instructs the child-venv to inherit
   all "parent" packages (numpy, pandas).

   Select a venv's  name to signify the version it will contains,
   e.g. ``co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv``.  The ``.venv`` at the end is not required,
   it is just for tagging the *venv* folders.

4. Workaround a `virtualenv bug <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/93>`_
   with `TCL/TK` on *Windows*!

   This is technically the most "difficult" step, and it is required so that
   CO2MPAS can open GUI dialog-boxes, such as those for selecting
   the *input/output* dialogs.

   a. Open with an editor the ``co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`` script,
   b. locate the `set PATH=...` line towards the bottom of the file, and
      append the following 2 lines::

        set "TCL_LIBRARY=d:\WinPython-XX4bit-3.Y.Y.Y\python-3.Y.Y.amd64\tcl\tcl8.6"
        set "TK_LIBRARY=d:\WinPython-XXit-3.Y.Y.Y\python-3.Y.Y.amd64\tcl\tk8.6"

   .. Warning::
       If you don't modify the *activation-script*, you will receive
       the following message while running CO2MPAS::

           This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.

       Of course you have to **adapt the paths above** to match the `TCL` & `TK`
       folder in your parent python-env.  For instance, in ALLINONE the lines
       above would become::

        set "TCL_LIBRARY=%WINPYTHON%\tcl\tcl8.6"
        set "TK_LIBRARY=%WINPYTHON%\tcl\tk8.6"

   .. Tip::
        The ALLINONE archives already include this workaround ;-)


5. "Activate" the new "venv" by running the following command
   (notice the dot(``.``) at the begining of the command):

   .. code-block:: console

        > .\co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   Or type this in *bash*:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ source co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   You must now see that your prompt has been prefixed with the venv's name.


6. Install the co2mpas version you want inside the activated venv.
   See the :ref:`co2mpas-install` section, above.

   Don't forget to check that what you get when running co2mpas is what you
   installed.

7. To "deactivate" the active venv, type:

   .. code-block:: console

       > deactivate

   The prompt-prefix with the venv-name should now dissappear.  And if you
   try to invoke ``co2mpas``, it should fail.



.. Tip::
    - Repeat steps 2-->5 to create venvs for different versions of co2mpas.
    - Use steps (6: Activate) and (9: Deactivate) to switch between different
      venvs.


Autocompletion
--------------
In order to press ``[Tab]`` and get completions, do the following in your
environment (ALLINONE is pre-configured with them):

- For the clink_ environment, on `cmd.exe`, add the following *lua* script
  inside clink's profile folder: ``clink/profile/co2mpas_autocompletion.lua``

  .. code-block:: lua

    --[[ clink-autocompletion for CO2MPAS
    --]]
    local handle = io.popen('co2mpas-autocompletions')
    words_str = handle:read("*a")
    handle:close()

    function words_generator(prefix, first, last)
        local cmd = 'co2mpas'
        local prefix_len = #prefix

        --print('P:'..prefix..', F:'..first..', L:'..last..', l:'..rl_state.line_buffer)
        if prefix_len == 0 or rl_state.line_buffer:sub(1, cmd:len()) ~= cmd then
            return false
        end

        for w in string.gmatch(words_str, "%S+") do
            -- Add matching app-words.
            --
            if w:sub(1, prefix_len) == prefix then
                clink.add_match(w)
            end

            -- Add matching files & dirs.
            --
            full_path = true
            nf = clink.match_files(prefix..'*', full_path)
            if nf > 0 then
                clink.matches_are_files()
            end
        end
        return clink.match_count() > 0
    end

    sort_id = 100
    clink.register_match_generator(words_generator)


- For the *bash* shell just add this command in your :file:`~/.bashrc`
  (or type it every time you open a new console):

  .. code-block:: console

      complete -fdev -W "`co2mpas-autocompletions`" co2mpas



.. _usage:

Usage
=====
.. Note::
    The following commands are for the **bash console**, specifically tailored
    for the **all-in-one** archive.  In `cmd.exe` the commands are rougly similar,
    but remember to substitute the slashes (`/`) in paths with backslashes(`\`).

    The :doc:`allinone` contains additionally batch-files
    (e.g. :file:`RUN_COMPAS.bat`, :file:`NEW_TEMPLATE.bat`, etc)
    that offer roughly the same capabillities described below.
    When you double-click them, the output from these commands gets to be
    written in the :file:`ALLINONE/CO2MPAS/co2mpas.log` file.



First ensure that the latest version of CO2MPAS is properly installed, and that
its version match the version declared on this file.

The main entry for the simulator is the ``co2mpas`` console-command,
which **is not visible, but it is installed in your PATH**.
To get the syntax of the ``co2mpas`` console-command, open a console where
you have installed CO2MPAS (see :ref:`install` above) and type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ co2mpas --help
    Predict NEDC CO2 emissions from WLTP cycles.

    Usage:
      co2mpas batch       [-v | --logconf <conf-file>]  [--predict-wltp] [--only-summary]
                          [--out-template <xlsx-file> | --charts] [--plot-workflow]
                          [-O <output-folder>]  [<input-path>]...  [--gui]
      co2mpas demo        [-v | --logconf <conf-file>] [-f] [<output-folder>]  [--gui]
      co2mpas template    [-v | --logconf <conf-file>] [-f] [<excel-file-path> ...]  [--gui]
      co2mpas ipynb       [-v | --logconf <conf-file>] [-f] [<output-folder>]  [--gui]
      co2mpas modelgraph  [-v | --logconf <conf-file>]
                          [--list | [--graph-depth=INTEGER] [<models> ...]]
      co2mpas [-v | --logconf <conf-file>] (--version | -V)
      co2mpas --help

    Options:
      <input-path>                Input xlsx-file or folder.
      -O <output-folder>          Output folder or file [default: .].
      --gui                       Launches GUI dialog-boxes to choose Input, Output and Options.
                                  [default: False].
      --only-summary              Does not save vehicle outputs just the summary file.
      --predict-wltp              Whether to predict also WLTP values.
      --charts                    Add basic charts to output file.
      --out-template <xlsx-file>  An '*.xlsx' file to clone and append model-results into it.

        modelgraph              List all or plot available models.  If no model(s) specified, all assumed.

    Examples for `cmd.exe`:
        # Create work folders ans fill them with sample-vehicles:
        md input output
        co2mpas demo input

        # Launch GUI dialog-boxes on the sample-vehicles just created:
        co2mpas batch --gui input

        # or specify them with output-charts and workflow plots:
        co2mpas batch input -O output --charts --plot-workflow

        # Create an empty vehicle-file inside `input` folder:
        co2mpas template input\vehicle_1.xlsx

        # View a specific submodel on your browser:
        co2mpas modelgraph gear_box_calibration


The default sub-command (``batch``) accepts either a single **input-excel-file**
or a folder with multiple input-files for each vehicle, and generates a
**summary-excel-file** aggregating the major result-values from these vehicles,
and (optionally) multiple **output-excel-files** for each vehicle run.


Running Demos
-------------
The simulator contains input-files for demo-vehicles that are a nice
starting point to try out.

1. Choose a folder where you will store the *input* and *output* files:

   .. code-block:: console

        ## Skip this if ``tutorial`` folder already exists.
        $ mkdir tutorial
        $ cd tutorial

        ## Skip also this if folders exist.
        $ mkdir input output

  .. Note::
    The input & output folders do not have to reside in the same parent,
    neither to have these names.
    It is only for demonstration purposes that we decided to group them both
    under a hypothetical ``some-folder``.

2. Create the demo vehicles inside the *input-folder* with the ``demo``
   sub-command:


   .. code-block:: console

        $ co2mpas demo input
        Creating DEMO INPUT file 'input\co2mpas_demo_1_full_data.xlsx'...
        Creating DEMO INPUT file 'input\co2mpas_demo_2_wltp_high_only.xlsx'...
        Creating DEMO INPUT file 'input\co2mpas_demo_3_wltp_low_only.xlsx'...
        Creating DEMO INPUT file 'input\co2mpas_demo_4_baseline_no_battery_currents - Copy.xlsx'...
        Creating DEMO INPUT file 'input\co2mpas_demo_5_baseline_no_gears.xlsx'...
        You may run DEMOS with:
            co2mpas batch input

3. Run the simulator on all demo-files:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ co2mpas batch input -O output
       Processing ['input'] --> 'output'...
       Processing: co2mpas_demo_1_full_data
       ...
       ...
       Done! [90.765501 sec]


4. Inspect the results:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ start output/*summary.xlsx       ## More summaries might exist in the folder from previous runs.
       $ start output                     ## View the folder with all files generated.


Output files
------------
The output-files produced on each run are the following:

- One file per vehicle, named as `<timestamp>-<inp-fname>.xls`:
  This file contains all the inputs and calculation results for each vehicle
  contained in the batch-run: scalar-parameters and time series for target,
  calibration and prediction phases, for all cycles.
  In addition, the file contains all the specific submodel-functions that
  generated the results, a comparison summary, and information on the python
  libraries installed on the system (for investigating reproducibility issues).

- A Summary-file named as `<timestamp>-summary.xls`:
  Major CO2 emissions values, optimized CO2 parameters values and
  success/fail flags of CO2MPAS submodels for all vehicles in the batch-run.


Entering new vehicles
---------------------
You may modify the samples vehicles and run again the model.
But to be sure that your vehicle does not contain by accident any of
the sample-data, use the ``template`` sub-command to make an *empty* input
excel-file:

1. Decide the *input/output* folders.  Assuming we are still in the ``tutorial``
   folder and we wish to re-use the ``input/output`` folders from the example
   above, we may clear all their contents with this:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ rm -r ./input/* ./output/*      ## Replace `rm` with `del` in *Windows* (`cmd.exe`)


2. Create an empty vehicle template-file (eg. ``vehicle_1.xlsx``) inside
   the *input-folder* with the ``template`` sub-command:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ co2mpas template input/vehicle_1.xlsx  ## Note that here we specify the filename, not the folder!
        Creating TEMPLATE INPUT file 'input/vehicle_1.xlsx'...


3. Open the template excel-file to fill-in your vehicle data
   (and save it afterwards):

   .. code-block:: console

        $ start input/vehicle_1.xlsx      ## Opens the excel-file. Use `start` in *cmd.exe*.

   .. Tip::
       The generated file contains help descriptions to help you populate it
       with vehicle data.  For items where an array of values is required
       (i.e. gear-box ratios) you may reference different parts of
       the spreadsheet following the syntax of the `"xlref" mini-language
       <https://pandalone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html#module-pandalone.xleash>`_.

       You may also read the `tutorial input xl-file
       <http://files.co2mpas.io/CO2MPAS-1.1.1.post1/co2mpas_tutorial_1_1_0.xls>`_
       to get an understanding of each scalar paramet and series required,
       but DO NOT USE THIS "fatty" xl-file (~40Mb) when running the model.

   You may repeat these last 2 steps if you want to add more vehicles in
   the *batch-run*.

4. Run the simulator.  Specify the single excel-file as input:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ co2mpas batch ./input/vehicle_1.xlsx -O output
        Processing './input/vehicle_1.xlsx' --> 'output'...
        Processing: vehicle_1
        ...
        Done! [12.938986 sec]

5. Assuming you do receive any error, you may now inspect the results:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ start output/*summary.xlsx      ## More summaries might open from previous runs.
        $ start output                    ## View all files generated (see below).


6. In the case of errors, or if the results are not satisfactory, repeat the
   above procedure from step 3 to modify the vehicle and re-run the model.
   See also :ref:`debug`, below.


Using custom output xl-files as templates
-----------------------------------------
You may have defined customized xl-files for summarizing time-series and
scalar parameters.  To have CO2MPAS fill those "output-template" files with
its results, execute it with the ``--out-template`` option.


To create/modify one output-template yourself, do the following:

1. Open a typical CO2MPAS output-file for some vehicle.

2. Add one or more sheets and specify/referring CO2MPAS result-data using
   `named-ranges <https://www.google.it/search?q=excel+named-ranges>`_.

   .. Warning::
   		Do not use simple/absolute excel references (e.g. "=B2").
   		Use excel functions (indirect, lookup, offset, etc.) and array-functions
   		together with string references to the named ranges
   		(e.g. "=indirect("nedc_predictions_time_series!_fuel_consumptions")").

3. (Optional) Delete the old sheets and save your file.

4. Use that file together with the ``--out-template`` argument.

.. tip::
    You can find a template/dummy output-template file here:
    http://files.co2mpas.io/CO2MPAS-1.1.1.post1/CO2MPAS_out_template.xlsx



Launch CO2MPAS from Jupyter(aka IPython)
----------------------------------------
You may enter the data for a single vehicle and run its simulation, plot its
results and experiment in your browser using `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_.

The usage pattern is similar to "demos" but requires to have **ipython**
installed:

1. Ensure *ipython* with *notebook* "extra" is installed:

   .. Warning::
        This step requires too many libraries to provide as standalone files,
        so unless you have it already installed, you will need a proper
        *http-connectivity* to the standard python-repo.

   .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install ipython[notebook]
        Installing collected packages: ipython[notebook]
        ...
        Successfully installed ipython-x.x.x notebook-x.x.x


2. Then create the demo ipython-notebook(s) into some folder
   (i.e. assuming the same setup from above, ``tutorial/input``):

   .. code-block:: console

        $ pwd                     ## Check our current folder (``cd`` alone for Windows).
        .../tutorial

        $ co2mpas ipynb ./input

3. Start-up the server and open a browser page to run the vehicle-simulation:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ ipython notebook ./input

4. A new window should open to your default browser (AVOID IEXPLORER) listing
   the ``simVehicle.ipynb`` notebook (and all the demo xls-files).
   Click on the ``*.ippynb`` file to "load" the notebook in a new tab.

   The results are of a simulation run already pre-generated for this notebook
   but you may run it yourself again, by clicking the menu::

        "menu" --> `Cell` --> `Run All`

   And watch it as it re-calculates *cell* by cell.

5. You may edit the python code on the cells by selecting them and clicking
   ``Enter`` (the frame should become green), and then re-run them,
   with ``Ctrl + Enter``.

   Navigate your self around by taking the tutorial at::

        "menu" --> `Help` --> `User Interface Tour`

   And study the example code and diagrams.

6. When you have finished, return to the console and issue twice ``Ctrl + C``
   to shutdown the *ipython-server*.


.. _debug:

Debugging and investigating results
-----------------------------------

- Make sure that you have installed `graphviz`, and when running the simulation,
  append also the ``--plot-workflow`` option.

- Use the ``modelgraph`` sub-command to plot the offending model (or just
  out of curiosity).  For instance:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ co2mpas modelgraph gear_box_calibration

  .. image:: _static/GearModel.png
    :alt: Flow-diagram of the Gear-calibration model.
    :height: 240
    :width: 320

- Inspect the functions mentioned in the workflow and models and search them
  in `CO2MPAS documentation <http://files.co2mpas.io/>`_ ensuring you are
  visiting the documents for the actual version you are using.


.. _explanation:

Explanation of the model
========================
There are potentially eight models to calibrate and run within CO2MPAS
(see :doc:`reference`):

1. ``AT_model``,
2. ``electric_model``,
3. ``clutch_torque_converter_model``,
4. ``co2_params``,
5. ``engine_cold_start_speed_model``,
5. ``engine_coolant_temperature_model``,
6. ``engine_speed_model``, and
7. ``start_stop_model``.

Each model is calibrated separately over *WLTP_H* and *WLTP_L*.
A model can contain one or several functions predicting different quantities.
For example, the electric_model contains the following functions/data:

- ``alternator_current_model``,
- ``alternator_status_model``,
- ``electric_load``,
- ``max_battery_charging_current``,
- ``start_demand``.

These functions/data are calibrated/estimated based on the provided input
(in the particular case: *alternator current*, *battery current*, and *initial SOC*)
over both cycles, assuming that data for both WLTP_H and WLTP_L are provided.

.. Note::
    The ``co2_params`` model has a third possible calibration configuration
    (so called `ALL`) using data from both WLTP_H and WLTP_L combined
    (when both are present).


Model selection
---------------
To select which is the best calibration (from *WLTP_H* or *WLTP_L* or *ALL*)
to be used in the prediction phase, the results of each stage are compared
against the provided input data (used in the calibration).
The calibrated models are THEN used to recalculate (predict) the inputs of the
*WLTP_H* and *WLTP_L* cycles. A **score** (weighted average of all computed metrics)
is attributed to each calibration of each model as a result of this comparison.

.. Note::
    The overall score attributed to a specific calibration of a model is
    the average score achieved when compared against each one of the input cycles
    (*WLTP_H* and *WLTP_L*).

    For example, the score of `electric_model` calibrated based on *WLTP_H*
    when predicting *WLTP_H* is 20, and when predicting *WLTP_L* is 14.
    In this case the overall score of the the `electric_model` calibrated
    based on *WLTP_H* is 17. Assuming that the calibration of the same model
    over *WLTP_L* was 18 and 12 respectively, this would give an overall score of 15.

    In this case the second calibration (*WLTP_L*) would be chosen for predicting the NEDC.

In addition to the above, a success flag is defined according to
upper or lower limits of scores which have been defined empirically by the JRC.
If a model fails these limits, priority is then given to a model that succeeds,
even if it has achieved a worse score.

The following table describes the scores, targets, and metrics for each model:
