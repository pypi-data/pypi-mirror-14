Example Documentation
=====================

One of the great things about defopt is that the same docstrings it uses to
parse arguments are consumed by other tools in the Python ecosystem.

This is the documentation generated by Sphinx for the examples_. You can click
the "Show Source" button to see the raw RST document that generated this page.

.. Not building examples.annotations because ReadTheDocs currently seems to
   have trouble building on Python 3 (examples.choices.Choice doesn't display
   properly). When that is resolved, I'll check the state of annotations in
   Sphinx.
