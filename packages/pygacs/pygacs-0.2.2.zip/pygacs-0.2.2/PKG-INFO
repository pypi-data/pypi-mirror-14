Description: 
        pygacs
        ======
        
        **Python toolkit to manipulate Gaia catalogue tables hosted at ESA's Gaia Archive Core Systems (GACS)**
        
        pygacs provides python modules for the access and manipulation (e.g. crossmatch) of
        tables in GACS. It employs the TAP command line access tools described
        in the 'Help' section of the GACS web pages (`<http://gaia.esac.esa.int/archive/>`_). 
        
        So far, only synchronous and authenticated access has been
        implemented. To fully use pygacs, in particular to upload a table for
        crossmatch operations, you will need to be a registered user of GACS
        and call the example script with your access credentials.
