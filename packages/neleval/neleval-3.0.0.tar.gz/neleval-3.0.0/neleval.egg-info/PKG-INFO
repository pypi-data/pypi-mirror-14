Description: Entity linking evaluation
        =========================
        
        Python evaluation scripts for `TAC <http://www.nist.gov/tac/>`__ entity
        linking and related wikification, named entity disambiguation, and
        within- and cross-document coreference tasks.
        
        Requires that ``python`` (2.7, with Py3k support experimental/partial)
        be installed on your system with ``numpy`` (and preferably ``scipy`` for
        fast CEAF calculation) and ``joblib``. ``matplotlib`` is required for
        the ``plot-systems`` command.
        
        See a list of commands with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ./nel --help
        
        Or install onto your Python path (e.g. with
        ``pip install git+https://github.com/wikilinks/neleval``) then
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python -m neleval --help
        
        TAC-KBP 2014 EDL quickstart
        ===========================
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ./scripts/run_tac14_evaluation.sh \
                /path/to/gold.xml \              # TAC14 gold standard queries/mentions
                /path/to/gold.tab \              # TAC14 gold standard link and nil annotations
                /system/output/directory \       # directory containing (only) TAC14 system output files
                /script/output/directory \       # directory to which results are written
                number_of_jobs                   # number of jobs for parallel mode
        
        Each file in in the system output directory is scored against gold.tab.
        
        Similar facility is available for TAC-KBP'15 EDL.
