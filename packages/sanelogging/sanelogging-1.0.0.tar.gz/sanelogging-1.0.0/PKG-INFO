Description: # sanelogging
        
        ## Sane defaults for python logging
        
        The python stdlib `logging` module is useful, flexible, and configurable.
        
        However, the maintainers reasonably have determined that python is an
        application runtime and not an application.  The default configuration
        for the `logging` is not very useful, and this results in boilerplate.
        
        This is an opinionated module for the 90% case where you just want sane
        defaults.  (In effect, moving the boilerplate into PyPI.)
        
        # Other Stuff
        
        There are some convenience methods added, such as `panic` and `die` (c.f.
        golang and perl).
        
        `notice` is additionally aliased to `info`, for those who forget that python
        doesn't have a notice level (i.e. me).
        
        If you set the environment variable `LOG_TO_SYSLOG`, it will print out your
        log messages on paper and mail them to you.
        
        # Usage
        
        ```
        from sanelogging import log
        
        log.info("starting up!")
        
        log.error("something went wrong.")
        
        log.die("bailing out") # script exits
        
        ```
