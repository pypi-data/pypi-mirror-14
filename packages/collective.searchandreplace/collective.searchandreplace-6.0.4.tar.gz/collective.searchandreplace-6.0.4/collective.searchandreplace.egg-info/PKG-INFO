        The collective.searchandreplace product is a Plone Add-on designed to
        find and replace text in Plone content objects, namely titles,
        descriptions, and document text. It operates over single or multiple
        Plone content objects and can show a preview of changes as well as
        immediately perform them.
        
        Optional features include being able to control searching in
        subfolders, and matching based on case sensitivity/insensitivity.
        
        Note: since version 6.0, we search and replace only items that
        implement the ``ISearchReplaceable`` interface.  Since this version,
        this interface can be set on dexterity content types using a
        behavior.  Note that when you enable or disable this interface on a
        content type, either through the web or in code, you should reindex
        the ``object_provides`` index in the ``portal_catalog``.
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        From collective.searchandreplace version 5.0, we are compatible with
        Plone 4.3 and 5.0.
        
        The collective.searchandreplace product was initally built for use
        with eduCommons by Novell, inc, later improved by EnPraxis.  It is
        currently maintained by Maurits van Rees.  Plone 5 support added by
        Gagaro.

        - Add separate permission for showing the action.  This makes it
          easier to restrict usage of Search and Replace if wanted.  By
          default the same roles have this permission as for the standard
          'Modify portal content' permission.  Added upgrade steps for this.
          Permission title is: 'collective.searchandreplace: Use Search And
          Replace'.

        - Enable searching the entire site. [davisagli]
