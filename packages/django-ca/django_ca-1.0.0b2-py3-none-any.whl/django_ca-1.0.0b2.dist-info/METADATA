django-ca provides you with a local TLS certificate authority. It is based on `pyOpenSSL <https://pyopenssl.readthedocs.org/>`_ and `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, it can be used as an app in an existing Django project or with the basic project included. Certificates can be managed through Djangos admin interface or via ``manage.py`` commands - no webserver is needed, if youâ€™re happy with the command-line.

Features:

* Set up a secure local certificate authority in just a few minutes.
* Written in Python3.4+.
* Manage your entire certificate authority from the command line and/or via
  Djangos admin interface.
* Get email notifications about certificates about to expire.
* Support for certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and OCSP (both have to be
  hosted separately).

Please see https://django-ca.readthedocs.org for more extensive documentation.
