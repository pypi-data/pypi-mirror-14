This a fairly complete implementation of OpenID Connect as
specified in http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html.
And as a side effect a complete implementation of OAuth2.0 too.

Cudos to Vladislav Mladenov and Christian Mainka both at
Horst GÃ¶rtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany
for helping me making the implementation more secure.
