        # Desctiption
        
        Lairucrem provides a useful user interface to the mercurial DVCS.
        
        It is a text-base interactive interface that helps developpers on
        their dayly usage of mercurial.
        
        It helps you in repetitve tasks like:
        
          $ hg log -G # display the tree
          $ hg rebase -r 12534 -d 13456 # move an interresting cset
          $ hg log -G # check you've done the right move
          $ hg up tip # up to the moved cset
          $ hg ci --amend # clean the patch and edit the commit message
          $ hg diff -c . # check you've got a good patch
          $ hg phase -d . # allow cset to be pushed
          $ hg push -r . # push your work
          $ hg log -G # look for stuff to rebase
          $ hg rebase -s 12535 -d . # linearize your graph
          $ hg log -G # check you've done the right move
        
        Lairucrem displays the changeset graph and the patch content of the
        focused changeset. When you change the focused cset, the patch content
        is automatically updated. We put some effort to make it quite responsive,
        even on huge repositories whith big patches.
        
        Lairucrem can proposes a set of actions that can be applied to the
        focused chageset, like rebase, update, addremove, etc. A small set of
        action are available in the actual version (later releases will propose
        more actions and a plugin system).
        
        Because it is a text-base interface, it can be used over ssh tunnel which is
        helpful when working on a remote machine.
        
        
        
        # Installation
        
        ## System wide (administrator privilege required)
        
            $ pip install lairucrem
        
        ## User space (no specific privilege required)
        
          $ pip install --user lairucrem
        
        # Development
        
        ## Environment
        
        You may want to use [https://virtualenv.readthedocs.or](virtualenv) to
        create an isolated Python environment.
        
          $ virtualenv /path/to/envs/lairucremenv
          $ source /path/to/envs/lairucremenv/bin/activate
        
        Clone the repository:
        
          $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/aleufroy/lairucrem
          $ cd lairucrem
        
        Install lairucrem and its development dependencies:
        
          $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt -e .
        
        ## Testsuite and checks
        
        - Run the testsuites
        
          $ py.test --doctest-modules --pylint -q
        
        Note:
        
          The `--pylint` option enables coding standards checks. Take a look
          at the `pylintrc` file for detailed coding rules used in lairucrem.
        
        - Test coverage
        
          $ py.test --doctest-modules --cov=lairucrem --cov-report term-missing
        
        ## Tricks
        
        I've added `pytest-xds` to dev_requirements.txt which allows
        py.test to watch for file system changes with the `-f` option.
        
        ## Pull request
        
        Please check the followings before sending your pull request:
        
        * Check the new feature/fix by add new tests or by adapting existing
          tests (test coverage is useful here). If your change does not need
          test change, tell it in the commit message.
        
        * Check that tests are all green (including the `--doctest-modules`
          and `--pylint` options).  If you are really reaaly sure that pylint
          is wrong (or if fixing the warning makes the code too much
          complicated), you can disable the warning by adding a comment like:
        
            #pylint: disable=signature-differs
        
        * Help me understand your patch with few lines in the commit message
          (do not translate your code :P).
        
        In the meantime, you can send me a message on twitter @alainleufroy.
