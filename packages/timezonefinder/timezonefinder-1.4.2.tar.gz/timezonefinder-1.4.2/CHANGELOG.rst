1.4.0 (2016-04-07)
------------------

* Added the ``file_converter.py`` to the repository:
It converts the .csv from pytzwhere to another .csv and this one into the used .bin
Especially the shortcut computation and the boundary storage in there save a lot of reading and computation time,
when deciding which timezone the cooridnates are in.
It will help to keep the package up to date, even when the timezone data should change in the future.
