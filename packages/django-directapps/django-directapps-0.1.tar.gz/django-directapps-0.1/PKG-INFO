Description: DirectApps
        ==========
        
        This is a little application for direct access to all the models and their
        data in a project. By default, the application has access for users with
        `is_staff` mark. But this and much more can be changed.
        
        It might interest you if you use Django as the backend to some kind of
        external client application. There are no templates for formatting and
        displaying of data on the client. Only JSON. Only direct data. All quickly and
        sharply.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            pip install django-directapps
        
        Change your next project files.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # settins.py

                'directapps',
                ...
            )
        
            # urls.py
            urlpatterns = [

                url(r'^apps/', include('directapps.urls', namespace="directapps")),
                ...
