Update from 0.9.12 requires manual changes! Sorry.

- the file `nive_cms.code.py` has been renamed to `nive_cms.codeblock.py`. Module
  registrations have to changed: `nive_cms.code` to `nive_cms.codeblock`

- extracted `nive_cms.design` and moved to separated package `nive_cms_design_bs2`
  Please replace all imports of `nive_cms.design` to `nive_cms_design_bs2`. And 
  do not forget to install the package first.

The default design is now based on bootstrap 3 and also available as separate package
`nive_cms_design_bs3`.
