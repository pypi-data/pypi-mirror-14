        Add and commit a new instance, gracefully handling failure in case a conflicting entry
        is already in the database (which may occur due to parallel requests causing race
        conditions in a production environment with multiple workers).

        Returns the instance saved to database if no error occured, or loaded from database
        using the provided filters if an error occured. If the filters fail to load from
        the database, the original IntegrityError is re-raised, as it is assumed to imply
        that the commit failed because of missing or invalid data, not because of a duplicate
        entry.

        Usage: ``db.session().add_and_commit(instance, **filters)`` where filters are the
        parameters passed to ``Model.query.filter_by(**filters).one()`` to load the instance.
