Description: ================
        Spectral Toolbox
        ================
        
        The SpectralToolbox is a collection of tools useful for spectral approximation methods in one or more dimensions.
        It include the construction of traditional orthogonal polynomials. Additionally one can construct orthogonal polynomials with respect to a selected measure.
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        Implementation of Spectral Methods in N dimension.
        
        Available polynomials:
            * Jacobi
            * Hermite Physicists'
            * Hermite Physicists' Function
            * Hermite Probabilists'
            * Hermite Probabilists' Function
            * Laguerre Polynomial
            * Laguerre Function
            * Fourier
            * ORTHPOL package (generation of recursion coefficients using [1]_)
        
        Available quadrature rules (related to selected polynomials):
            * Gauss
            * Gauss-Lobatto
            * Gauss-Radau
        
        Available quadrature rules (without polynomial selection):
            * Kronrod-Patterson on the real line
            * Kronrod-Patterson uniform
            * Clenshaw-Curtis
            * Fejer's
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
          * `numpy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`_
          * `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`_
          * `orthpol <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/orthpol>`_ >= 0.2.2
        
        Installation (using pip)
        ========================
        
        For everything to go smooth, I suggest that you first install the requirements separately, even if in some environments the direct installation of SpectralToolbox should work.
        
           $ pip install numpy 
        
           $ pip install scipy
        
           $ pip install Sphinx
        
           $ pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex
        
        You should intall the `orthpol <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/orthpol>`_ package. This dependency is required since v. 0.2.0. The installation might require you to tweak some flags for the compiler (with gcc nothing should be needed).
        
           $ pip install --install-option="install" orthpol
        
        Finally you can install the toolbox by:
        
           $ pip install SpectralToolbox
        
        Installation (using Anaconda)
        =============================
        
        There is no anaconda package right now, so the dependencies and the installation must be carried out manually. First resolve some of the dependencies through conda:
        
           $ conda install pip
        
           $ conda install numpy
        
           $ conda install scipy
        
        Resolve the remaining dependencies manually:
           
            $ cd <download_dir>
        
            $ pip install -d ./ <package>
        
            $ tar xzf <package>-X.X.X.tar.gz
        
            $ cd <package>-X.X.X
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        where <package> are in sequence: orthpol, SpectralToolbox.
