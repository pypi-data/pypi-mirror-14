        Documentation
        -------------
        
        ``rios_preprocessor`` is meant as a replacement for the ArcGIS python
        code that currently produces the inputs for the main RIOS program.
        
        ``rios_preprocessor`` produces rasters of:
        
        -  Downslope retention index
        -  Upslope source
        -  Riparian index
        -  Slope index
        
        that are used as input for the following RIOS objectives:
        
        -  Erosion Control
        -  Nitrogen Retention
        -  Phosphorus
        -  Flood Mitigation
        -  Groundwater Recharge/Baseflow
        
        Along the way, there are some additional tricks ``rios_preprocessor``
        uses that may be useful in other contexts:
        
        -  rasterizes an input shapefile river network and matches it to a
           (raster) DEM/DTM
        -  identifies discontinuous river banks along a rasterized river
        -  identifies the end points of rasterized rivers
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        -  numpy
        -  pandas
        -  geopandas
        -  fiona
        -  rasterio
        -  shapely
        -  pygeoprocessing
