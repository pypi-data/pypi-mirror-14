# base-node-rpc #

Base classes for Arduino RPC node/device.

 - A memory-efficient set of base classes providing an API to most of the
   Arduino API, including EEPROM access, raw I2C master-write/slave-request,
   etc.
 - Support for processing RPC command requests through either serial or I2C
   interface.
 - Utilizes Python (host) and C++ (device) code generation from the
   [`arduino_rpc`][1] package.


## Install ##

The Python package can be installed through `pip` using the following command:

    pip install base-node-rpc

--------------------------------------------------

# Default base node firmware #

## Upload firmware ##

To upload the pre-compiled firmware included in the Python package, run the
following command:

    python -m base_node_rpc.bin.upload <board type>

replacing `<board type>` with either `uno` or `mega2560`, depending on the
model of the board.

This will attempt to upload the firmware by automatically discovering the
serial port.  On systems with multiple serial ports, use the `-p` command line
argument to specify the serial port to use.  For example:

    python -m base_node_rpc.bin.upload -p COM3 uno

## Usage ##

After uploading the firmware to the board, the `base_node_rpc.Proxy` class can be
used to interact with the Arduino device.

See the session log below for example usage.

### Example interactive session ###

    >>> from serial import Serial
    >>> from base_node_rpc import Proxy

Connect to serial device.

    >>> serial_device = Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', baudrate=115200)

Initialize a device proxy using existing serial connection.

    >>> proxy = Proxy(serial_device)

Query the number of bytes free in device RAM.

    >>> proxy.ram_free()
    1211

Query descriptive properties of device.

    >>> proxy.properties()

Use Arduino API methods interactively.

    >>> # Set pin 13 as output
    >>> proxy.pin_mode(13, 1)
    >>> # Turn led on
    >>> proxy.digital_write(13, 1)
    >>> # Turn led off
    >>> proxy.digital_write(13, 0)

Note that most of the Arduino API is available as methods of the proxy:

    >>> proxy.

# Extending base firmware #

While the (precompiled) base firmware is likely flexible enough for many
applications, one of the key goals of this project is to allow for easy
extension and customization.

The following section describes the main `BaseNode` class and the various
[mixin][5] classes to provide modular inclusion of various Arduino libraries
(e.g., EEPROM, SPI, I2C) as RPC methods.

## C++ Base classes ##

The following classes may be used to form a basis for an Arduino RPC firmware
that may be interacted with through either a serial port or through I2C (the
same code path is used for buffers regardless of the source interface).

### BaseNode ###

The `BaseNode` class provides methods to identify key properties of a device
and exposes most of the Arduino API.  The `BaseNode` class is intended as a
base class, to be extended by combining with the remaining `Base*` classes.

### BaseNodeConfig ###

The `BaseNodeConfig` class provides methods to interact with a persistent
device configuration.  The main methods are:

 - `load_config`: Load a config from persistent storage (e.g., EEPROM).
 - `save_config`: Write a config to persistent storage.
 - `reset_config`: Reset in-memory config to default values.
 - `serialize_config`: Serialize in-memory config to a byte array.
 - `update_config`: Update in-memory config based on a serialized config.

Note that the `BaseNodeConfig` class is a template class, with two template
parameters:

 - `typename ConfigMessage`:
     * The configuration class to use.
     * Must have the methods: `load(address)`, `save(address)`, `reset()`,
       `serialize()`, and `update(serialized)`.
 - `uint8_t Address`: Address in persistent storage where config is stored.

__NB__ : Currently, the configuration class is assumed to be a
[Protocol Buffer][2] message type class, with Arduino code generated using the
[`nanopb`][3] library.  The `nanopb` library is also used for encoding/decoding
the messages.  The [`nanopb-helpers`][4] package provides a mechanism for
validating updates to a `nanopb` instance (see "Config validation").

#### Config validation ####

__TODO__ Add description of callback methods.


### BaseNodeEeprom ###

The `BaseNodeEeprom` class is a mixin to add methods for interfacing with
Arduino EEPROM.

The following methods are provided:

 - `update_eeprom_block(address, data)`: Write data byte array to EEPROM
   address.  Only write to the EEPROM if values have changed.
 - `read_eeprom_block(address, n)`: Read `n` bytes from EEPROM at address to
   bytes array.

### BaseNodeI2c ###

The `BaseNodeI2c` class is a mixin to add methods for interfacing with
Arduino I2C bus

The following methods are provided:

 - `set_i2c_address(address)`: Set I2C address.
 - `i2c_address`: Query I2C address.
 - `i2c_buffer_size`: Query TWI library buffer length.
 - `i2c_scan`: Return array of addresses found on I2C bus.
 - `i2c_available`: Number of bytes available in incoming I2C buffer.
 - `i2c_read_byte`: Read byte from I2C buffer.
 - `i2c_request_from(address, n_bytes_to_read)`: Request data from I2C slave.
 - `i2c_read(address, n_bytes_to_read)`: Request followed by read to array.
 - `i2c_write(address, data)`: Write byte array to address.

### BaseNodeSpi ###

The `BaseNodeSpi` class is a mixin to add methods for interfacing with the
Arduino SPI API.

The following methods are provided:

 - `set_spi_bit_order(order)`
 - `set_spi_clock_divider(divider)`
 - `set_spi_data_mode(mode)`
 - `spi_transfer(value)`

See the Arduino SPI API reference for details.

### BaseNodeState ###

The `BaseNodeState` class provides methods to interact with an in-memory device
state structure.  The main methods are:

 - `reset_state`: Reset in-memory state to default values.
 - `serialize_state`: Serialize in-memory state to a byte array.
 - `update_state`: Update in-memory state based on a serialized state.

Note that the `BaseNodeState` class is a template class, with the following
template parameter:

 - `typename StateMessage`:
     * The state class to use.
     * Must have the methods: `reset()`, `serialize()`, and
       `update(serialized)`.

__NB__ : Currently, the state class is assumed to be a
[Protocol Buffer][2] message type class, with Arduino code generated using the
[`nanopb`][3] library.  The `nanopb` library is also used for encoding/decoding
the messages.  The [`nanopb-helpers`][4] package provides a mechanism for
validating updates to a `nanopb` instance (see "State validation").

#### State validation ####

__TODO__ Add description of callback methods.


### BaseNodeI2cHandler ###

The `BaseNodeI2cHandler` class is a mixin to add methods for handling RPC
requests from the I2C interface.  The main methods are:


 - `max_i2c_payload_size`: Return maximum serialized command size supported by
   the I2C interface handler.
 - `i2c_request(address, data)`: Send a serialized command byte array to the
   specified I2C address and return serialized response array.

### BaseNodeSerialHandler ###

The `BaseNodeSerialHandler` class is a mixin to add methods for handling RPC
requests from the serial interface.  The main methods are:

 - `max_serial_payload_size`: Return maximum serialized command size supported
   by the serial interface handler.
