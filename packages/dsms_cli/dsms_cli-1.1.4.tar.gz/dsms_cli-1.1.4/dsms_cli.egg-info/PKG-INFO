Description: DSMS CLI tool
        --------------------
        
        dsms_cli is a command line interface for exporting reports from a DSMS
        system.
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        ``pip install dsms-cli``
        
        ========
        Setup
        ========
        
        Before you'll begin, you'll need several settings set as environment variables:
        
        * DSMS_SERVER    (e.g. https://mydsmsserver)
        * DSMS_USER      (e.g. tom)
        * DSMS_PASS      (e.g. ThisIsMyPassword)
        * DSMS_SERVER_CERT (optional: e.g. /usr/share/ca-certificates/dsmserver.crt)
        
        =========
        Adding targets
        =========
        
        To add targets, you'll firstly need the ID numbers of the schedules, profiles
        and severities you wish to add. You can do this with::
        
            dsms_cli list schedules
            dsms_cli list profiles
            dsms_cli list severities
        
        Then, you're ready to add targets. For example::
        
            dsms_cli add location --profile=1 --schedule=1 http://example.com
            dsms_cli add file --profile=2 --schedule=1 mysample.exe
        
        For file types, the local file path you specify will be uploaded to DSMS.
        
        =========
        Running reports
        =========
        
        
        You can also run searches of DSMS results using the same filter syntax as the
        web application. For example, to get all active phishing targets, run::
        
            dsms_cli export --query="status:Active type:Phishing"
        
        You can also redact potentially sensitive information in target information
        by supplying the --redact switch. This will replace URLs like
        http://example.com/?id=me@example.com with
        http://example.com/?id=REDACTED@REDACTED.
        
        =========
        Report formats
        =========
        
        Reports are generated by Jinja2 templates. If you'd like to add new types of
        reports, you can place these in a separate directory and tell dsms_report where
        to find these using ``dsms_cli export --template_dir=[your custom templates]``.
        
        =========
        SSL errors
        =========
        
        If you're using DSMS with a self-signed SSL certificate, you may run into the
        following error::
        
            RuntimeError: Error during login: bad handshake: Error([('SSL routines',
            'SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE', 'certificate verify failed')],)
        
        There are two options to avoid this.
        
        1) You can specify the path to a trusted SSL certificate using the
        DSMS_SERVER_CERT environment setting. To get this cert, you can run::
        
            openssl s_client -showcerts -connect [YOUR DSMS HOST]:443 </dev/null \
            2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM >dsms_server_cert.crt
        
        Then, set the cert path to the file you downloaded::
        
            export DSMS_SERVER_CERT=dsms_server_cert.crt
        
        2) While not recommended, you can also ignore all SSL errors by appending
        --ignore_ssl_errs to your dsms_cli command.
        
        =========
        Further help
        =========
        
        To see all command line switches, you can run::
        
            dsms_cli --help
