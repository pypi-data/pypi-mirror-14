Description: python-redfish
        ==============
        
        This repository will be used to house the Redfish python library, a reference
        implementation to enable Python developers to communicate with the Redfish API
        (http://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish).
        
        NOTE::
        
            DRAFT - WORK IN PROGRESS
        
            The current Redfish specification revision is 1.0.0 - Note that the mockup 
            is still at version 0.99.0a and may not reflect what the standard provides 
            fully
        
        
        Project Structure
        -------------------
        
        This project follows the same convention as OpenStack projects, eg. using pbr
        for build and test automation::
        
            doc/            # Documentation
            doc/source      # The doc source files live here
            doc/build/html  # Output of building any docs will go here
            dmtf            # Reference documents and mockup provided by the DMTF
            examples/       # Any sample code using this library, eg. for education
                            # should be put here
            pbconf          # Project builder file to build rpm/deb packages for
                            # distributions
            redfish/        # The redfish library itself
            redfish/tests/  # Python redfish unit test suite
            redfish-client  # Client tool to manage redfish devices
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        To use the enclosed examples, you will need Python 2.7
        (https://www.python.org/downloads/).  Note that Python 2.7.9 enforces greater
        SSL verification requiring server certificates be installed. Parameters to
        relax the requirements are available in the library, but these configurations
        are discouraged due to security.
        
        Python requirements are listed in requirements.txt; additional requirements for
        running the unit test suite are listed in test-requirements.txt.
        
        Get the sources
        ---------------
        
        The sources are available on github and can be retrieved using::
        
            git clone https://github.com/uggla/python-redfish
        
        As python redefish is currently in heavy development we recommend to checkout the devel branch using::
        
            cd python-redfish
            git checkout devel
