Description: RC QueryBuilder: Fluent QueryBuilder for MongoDB
        ================================================
        
        The **rcquerybuilder** package provides a fluent api wrapper around pymongo queries.
        
        This allows you to write and execute mongodb queries like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from rcquerybuilder.builder import Builder
            >>> qb = Builder(collection=None)
            >>> qb.field('name').equals('foobar') \
            ...   .field('fizz').ne(None) \
            ...   .get_query_list()
            {'name': 'foobar', 'fizz': {'$ne': None}}
