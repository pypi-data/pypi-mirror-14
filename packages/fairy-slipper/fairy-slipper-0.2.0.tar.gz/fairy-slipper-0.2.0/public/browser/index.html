    OpenStack Programming API

</div>

An Application Programming Interface (API) offers a way to use the
capabilities of a service by using predefined functions. Use the API
when the programming language you're using is not supported in an
SDK. Please consider contributing that work to one of the Known
SDKs. The OpenStack API Quick Start gives you the basics for
interacting with the services.
