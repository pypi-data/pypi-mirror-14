Description: mtg\_ssm - Magic: the Gathering Spreadsheet Manager
        ===================================================
        
        |Build Status| |Coverage Status|
        
        This is a tool for creating/updating user-friendly spreadsheets with
        Magic: the Gathering collection information. The tool can also
        import/export data to/from these spreadsheets to other formats, such as
        CSV files.
        
        As a matter of convenience, you can store the created spreadsheet in
        Dropbox, Google Drive, or the like and access your collection from
        anywhere.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        mtg\_ssm is available on PyPI so, if you have python (>=3.4) and pip
        installed on your system, you should be able to get mtg\_ssm by entering
        the following into a terminal:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip3 install mtg_ssm
        
        Updates can be performed by entering:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip3 install -U mtg_ssm
        
        You can verify installation from the terminal by running:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm --help
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        For first time use, you will want to create an empty spreadsheet with
        card data:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm collection.xlsx create
        
        In the future, when new sets are released, you can update your
        spreadsheet with new cards:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm collection.xlsx update
        
        Existing collections
        --------------------
        
        If you already have your cards in another collection store, you might
        want to import that collection into your card database.
        
        First create an example csv file:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm collection.xlsx create
            mtg-ssm collection.xlsx export collection.csv.example
        
        Then create a matching csv and import into your database:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm collection.xlsx import collection.csv
        
        In development
        ==============
        
        This tool is a work in progress. It is fully working now and I use it
        for tracking my own, personal collection, but it is somewhat tailored to
        my needs. There are, also, quite a few features that I would like to add
        and bits of code to cleanup (of course, every project always needs some
        code cleanup).

        Pull requests are welcome and contributions are greatly appreciated.

        -  `Wizards of the Coast <http://magic.wizards.com/>`__: For making
           Magic: the Gathering and continuing to support it. Off and on, it's
           been my favorite hobby since the early '90s.
        -  `MTG JSON <http://mtgjson.com>`__: MTG JSON is an amazing resource
           for anyone looking to build tools around magic card data. It is
           pretty much **THE** source for structured magic card data. Without
           MTG JSON this project would not have been possible.
