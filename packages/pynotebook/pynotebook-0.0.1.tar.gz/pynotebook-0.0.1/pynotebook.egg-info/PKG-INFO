        ==========
        
        A notebook interface similar to mathematica / ipython.
        
        
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Pynotebook is a command shell for interactive computing. The notebook
        concept originally appeared with the program Mathematica and became
        famous for python with the iPython project. Unlike iPython, pynotebook
        does not need a webbrowser and is very light weight.
        
        Pynotebook has the following features: 
        
        - command completion (tab-key)
        - syntax highlighting
        - small sice 
        - no external dependencies (except wx)
        - can be easily embedded in projects
        - works well with matplotlib
        
        
        As a demo application, there is a simple notebook interface to the r
        language, which uses rpy2 for interfacing gnu r and pygments for
        colorization.
