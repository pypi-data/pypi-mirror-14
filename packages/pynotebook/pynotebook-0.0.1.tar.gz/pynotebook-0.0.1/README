pynotebook
==========

A notebook interface similar to mathematica / ipython.



Introduction
------------

Pynotebook is a command shell for interactive computing. The notebook
concept originally appeared with the program Mathematica and became
famous for python with the iPython project. Unlike iPython, pynotebook
does not need a webbrowser and is very light weight.

Pynotebook has the following features: 

- command completion (tab-key)
- syntax highlighting
- small sice 
- no external dependencies (except wx)
- can be easily embedded in projects
- works well with matplotlib


As a demo application, there is a simple notebook interface to the r
language, which uses rpy2 for interfacing gnu r and pygments for
colorization.
