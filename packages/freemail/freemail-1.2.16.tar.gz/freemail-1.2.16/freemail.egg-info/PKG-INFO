        freemail
        ========
        
        A database of free and
        `disposable <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_email_address>`__
        email domains and a handy Node.js module for querying it.
        
        Install via npm or pip or access the files in the ``./data`` directory
        and parse with your language of choice.
        
        In an effort to create the most up-to-date list of domains, the database
        can be synchronized with various lists from around the web. You can also
        add new domains directly by opening a pull request.
        
        Database
        --------
        
        There are three key data files in this project:
        
        -  `free.txt <https://github.com/wearespindle/freemail/blob/master/data/free.txt>`__
           contains a list of domains that are known to provide free email
           service
        -  `disposable.txt <https://github.com/wearespindle/freemail/blob/master/data/disposable.txt>`__
           contains a list of domains that are known to provide disposable email
           service
        -  `blacklist.txt <https://github.com/wearespindle/freemail/blob/master/data/blacklist.txt>`__
           contains a list of domains that this project will refuse to add to
           either list
        
        Domains may only be a member of one list.
        
        Updating the database
        ---------------------
        
        Run ``./update`` to pull in the latest domains from the sources listed
        in ``sources.txt``. All new domains will be placed in ``free.txt`` by
        default. If any domains provide disposable email service, they may be
        moved to ``disposable.txt``.
