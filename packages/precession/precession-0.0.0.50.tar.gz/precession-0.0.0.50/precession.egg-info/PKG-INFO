        DYNAMICS OF SPINNING BLACK-HOLE BINARIES WITH PYTHON
        ====================================================
        
        ``precession`` is an open-source Python module to study the
        post-Newtonian dynamics of precessing black-hole binaries. The code
        provides a self-consistent framework to (i) study the evolution of the
        black-hole spins along their precession cycles, (ii) perform
        gravitational-wave driven binary inspirals using both standard
        integrations and innovative multi-timescale methods, and (iii) predict
        the properties of the black-hole remnant using fitting formulae to
        numerical relativity simulations. Flexibility, ease-of-use and numerical
        efficiency make ``precession`` the ideal tool to insert black-hole spin
        dynamics in larger-scale numerical studies such as gravitational-wave
        parameter-estimation codes, populations synthesis models to predict
        gravitational-wave event rates, galaxy merger trees and cosmological
        simulations of structure formation. ``precession`` provides fast and
        reliable integration methods to propagate statistical samples of
        black-hole binaries from/to large separations where they form to/from
        small separations where they become detectable, thus linking
        gravitational-wave observations of spinning black-hole binaries to their
        astrophysical formation history. The code is also a promising tool to
        compute post-Newtonian injections to numerical relativity simulations
        targeting the spin precession dynamics.

        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        ``precession`` works in python 2.x and has been tested on 2.7.10. It can
        be installed through `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/precession>`__:
        
        ::
        
            pip install precession
        
        Prerequisites are ``numpy``, ``scipy`` and ``parmap``, which can be all
        installed through pip. Information on all code functions are available
        through Pyhton's built-in help system
        
        ::
        
            import precession
            help(precession.function)
        
        Several tests and tutorial are available in the submodule
        ``precession.test``.
