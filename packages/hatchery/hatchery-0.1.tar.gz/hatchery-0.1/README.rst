A helper for continuous delivery of python packages

What is the problem, exactly?
-----------------------------

Python's packaging and distribution scheme is really designed for manual
intervention, most notably as regards versions. In your typical project,
the version is hardcoded *somewhere* in the source tree, and the project
history will be littered with messages like "bumped version to x.y."
Isn't this what tagging is for? Also, why should a work in progress be
given a version number in the first place? It seems backwards. It also
is solvable.

Aside from that major issue, there are a number of minor annoyances that
arise when handling python projects in github. Chief among these is the
problem of README files. Github clearly prefers ``README.md`` files, and
the markdown syntax widely available and very natural to use. Pypi, on
the other hand, requires the use of ``README.rst`` files (or at least
that format) in order to display on the project's main site. I find this
more difficult to work with and, regardless, one should be able to use
one's preferred README syntax. Converting from one to the other is
doable, so it should also be simple.

Finally, when doing any kind of modification of source files on the fly
(a build process) it is important that the package tree be untouched.
This is largely due to the fact that an automated tagging process
(critical to CD) falls down when the working copy is dirty. As such,
automated management of a working directory which can be safely ignored
in VCS is an integrated part of ``hatchery``.

Core features
-------------

-  Isolation of all source manipulations to a working directory
   (``.hatchery.work``)
-  On-the-fly version management using the popular ``_version.py``
   specification method \*\* Logic to make sure that only accepted (PEP)
-  Optional on-the-fly readme conversion from ``md`` to ``rst``
-  Notion of "tasks" which must be run in a particular order
-  Dictate as little project structure as possible (see below)

Project prerequisites
---------------------

As of the time of this writing, there are a few prerequisites that a
project must meet in order to integrate with ``hatchery``:

-  The project should consist of a single root package which contains
   all of the python logic. That package can be as large or as small as
   is needed, containing as many subpackages as you like, but there must
   only be one.
-  There are some code requirements in ``setup.py`` and
   ``<packagename>._version.py``. Run ``hatchery check`` for more
   information. And don't worry, if these prereqs aren't met,
   ``hatchery`` will tell you about it instead of doing something wonky.
-  In order to make use of some of the features (running tests,
   registering and uploading releases of your project), you will have to
   maintain a configuration file. More information below.

Installation
------------

::

    $ pip install hatchery

As always, it is strongly recommended that you use this inside of a
virtual environment.

Configuration
-------------

As previously mentioned, in order to take full advantage of what
``hatchery`` has to offer, there is a little configuration that is
required...and I do mean a little. There are a number of parameters
avialable, but most of them can just be left to their default values:

+-----------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter             | Default value   | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
+=======================+=================+=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| ``auto_push_tag``     | ``False``       | Automatically run the tag-and-push logic after a successful upload operation                                                                                                                                                        |
+-----------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``create_wheel``      | ``True``        | Create a wheel along with the source distribution during the packaging step                                                                                                                                                         |
+-----------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``git_remote_name``   | ``'origin'``    | The name of the remote to push to when pushing a git tag                                                                                                                                                                            |
+-----------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``pypi_repository``   | ``None``        | String parameter describing which pypi index server to upload packages to. It actually refers to an alias which must be defined in your `pypirc file <https://docs.python.org/3.5/distutils/packageindex.html#the-pypirc-file>`__   |
+-----------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``readme_to_rst``     | ``True``        | Convert a README.md file to README.rst on the fly if the former is detected and the latter is not                                                                                                                                   |
+-----------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``test_command``      | ``None``        | A list of arbitrary shell commands that should be run during the test task. If any of them fails, the test will be considered a failure.                                                                                            |
+-----------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

These parameters should be defined in `yaml
format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`__ in the file
``.hatchery.yml`` in the root of your project. If you want to make any
of them global across all your projects, you can also choose to define
them in ``~/.hatchery/hatchery.yml``; just remember that the
project-level file's values will always win!

See ``.hatchery.yml`` in this repository for a contextual example.

Aside: there are lots of different opinions about how best to test one's
code. There are many frameworks, and many ways to execute them. Allowing
users to have complete control over this was a key design decision. You
want to use ``tox``? Go for it! Prefer using ``py.test`` directly? Fine
by me. Think ``pylint`` is important? Throw it on there! The point is,
choose what testing feedback is important to you, and ``hatchery`` will
execute it for you.

Examples
--------

Make sure you have all of the prerequisites in place

::

    $ hatchery check

Run all tests defined in configuration

::

    $ hatchery clean test

Register your project with the pypi repository defined in configuration

::

    $ hatchery register

Create packages (with markdown -> rst conversion)

::

    $ hatchery package --release-version=1.2.3

Upload your packages to the pypi repository defined in configuration

::

    $ hatchery upload

String everything together in one go!

::

    $ hatchery clean register test package upload --release-version=1.2.3

Postscript
----------

I wrote this utility because it helps me to work in the way in which I
am most productive. It will not be perfect for everyone...not yet. If
you think there's something missing that would help you find your happy
path, please open up a feature request. Better yet, implement it and
throw up a pull request. Feedback is welcome!
