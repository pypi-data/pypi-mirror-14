"""
Classes for writing and filtering of processed reads.

To determine what happens to a read, a list of filters is created and each
one is called in turn (via its __call__ method) until one returns True.
The read is then assumed to have been "consumed", that is, either written
somewhere or filtered (should be discarded). Filters and writers are currently
not distinguished: The idea is that at least one of the filters will apply.
