Description: Debug cache
        ===========
        
        **Note**. This is Alpha software, use with caution.
        
        A cache meant to speed up debugging and testing process. Stores intermediate results in files.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            pip install debug-cache
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from debug_cache import DebugCache
            cache = DebugCache(path='/path/to/debug_cache')
        
            # or just use default
            from debug_cache import cache
        
        
        First ``debug_cache`` usage is to fasten repeated and heavy calls to tighten edit/rerun loop:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            @cache.cached
            def some_function(x, y):
                # do something
                return res
        
        
        Second ``debug_cache`` usage is to check that function results didn't change. Useful when refactoring or optimizing:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # Check that function results didn't change, they need to be cached first
            @cache.checked
            def some_function(x, y):
                # ...
        
            # Same, but cache first time, check all subsequent ones
            @cache.checked(strict=False)
            def some_function(x, y):
                # ...
        
        
        This will stop and start debugger if function results don't match ones saved earlier. Strict version also stops if no cached results are found.
