        VESNA ALH Authentication proxy
        ==============================
        
        This package contains a deamon (``vesna_alh_auth_proxy``) that proxies
        ALH requests from a Unix domain socket to an ALH web end-point. It performs
        authentication based on the system user originating request. This enables
        multiple users on a system to share the same credentials for the ALH web
        end-point, without exposing the credentials to them.
        
        An ALH implementation class ``vesna.omf.ALH`` is also provided that uses the
        service provided by the proxy. Compared to the usual ``ALHWeb`` class, this
        does not require any parameters for its construction. ``base_url`` and
        ``cluster_id`` are added by the proxy from its configuration file based on
        ``cluster_uid``. ``cluster_uid`` is set from the environment, which typically
        comes from the OMF Resource Proxy.
