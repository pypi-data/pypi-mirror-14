Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

Numscrypt is currently tested under Windows and Linux. To install it, type

*pip install numscrypt*

from the command prompt. This will also install Transcrypt if it's not yet there.

You can test your installation as follows:

1.	Go to directory *../Transcrypt-<version>/transcrypt/development/automated_tests/transcrypt*
2.	From the command prompt run *transcrypt -b autotest.py*. This will compile the autotests into file *autotest.js* and put it into the *__javascript__* subdirectory. Do NOT go to that directory (there's no need, stay where you went at point 4)
3.	From the command prompt run *transcrypt -r autotest.py*. This will run the autotests with CPython creating file *autotest.html* that refers to the generated *autotest.js* file
4.	Load the autotest.html into your browser, e.g. by clicking on it (tests were done with Chrome). It will load *autotest.js*, run it and compare the output with what was generated by CPython. It should report no errors

To experiment with Numscrypt yourself:

1.	Create a directory for your experiments
2.	Make your own thing there, e.g. *experiment1.py*
3.	Compile with *transcrypt -b experiment1.py*
4.	Make an HTML page that will load your code in the browser. Use the HTML file generated by the autotest as an example of how to do that
5.	Load and run the HTML + JS
