Owner Credit is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3
and is also available under alternative Commercial licenses negotiated directly
with Hard Consulting Corporation. If you obtained Owner Credit under the
GPL, then the GPL applies to all Owner Credit modules used on your system
as well, except as defined below. The GPL (version 3) is included in this source
tree in the file COPYING.

Hard Consulting Corporation holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all
components of the Owner Credit package, and therefore can grant, at its
sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or organizations to
create proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may use at
runtime the portions of Owner Credit which fall under the umbrella of our
copyright/license, or are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no
requirement that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products (although
if you've written a module for Owner Credit we would strongly encourage
you to make the same exception that we do).

If you have any questions regarding our licensing policy, please contact us:
