Instead, we keep a global mapping of biosphere and technosphere flows to integers - this is what `mapping` is, a dictionary from flows to integers, which is in a sense just a giant counter. Each new flow inserted into `mapping` gets the next biggest integer. `index` will be the index in the matrix, e.g. row 0 or row 42.\n",
