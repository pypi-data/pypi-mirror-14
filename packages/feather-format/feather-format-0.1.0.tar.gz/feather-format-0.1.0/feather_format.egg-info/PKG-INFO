Description: ## Python interface to the Apache Arrow-based Feather File Format
        
        Feather efficiently stores pandas DataFrame objects on disk.
        
        ## Build
        
        Building Feather requires a C++11 compiler. We've simplified the PyPI packaging
        to include libfeather (the C++ core library) to be built statically as part of
        the Python extension build, but this may change in the future.
        
        ## Limitations
        
        Some features of pandas are not supported in Feather:
        
        * Non-string column names
        * Row indexes
        * Object-type columns with non-homogeneous data
        
        ## Mac notes
        
        Anaconda uses a default 10.5 deployment target which does not have C++11
        properly available. This can be fixed by setting:
        
        ```
        export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.10
        ```
