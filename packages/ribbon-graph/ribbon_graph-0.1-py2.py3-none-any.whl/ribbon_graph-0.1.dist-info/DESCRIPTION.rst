# RibbonGraph
A Declarative Graph API Django App

RibbonGraph is a Django app which provides a declarative permission layer to a
Neo4j database. It is perfect for building social networking applications.

The RibbonGraph philosophy is that a social graph is a shared resource for all
the users that has rules about how the users are allowed to use the graph.

Therefore all that's required to have a social network is a declaration those
rules. This is what RibbonGraph provides.
