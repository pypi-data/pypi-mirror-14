The Protein-Protein Subnetwork Challenge: Description
=========================================================================

For a large number of combination of baits and prey genes, a high throuput panel of Y2H interactions were tested for yeast proteins. From all the protein-protein interactions found in these experiments, we extracted a set of gene pairs that were found to interact in at least three repetitions of the experiment. We also identified a set of gene-pairs that were never found to interact. Given the list of genes participating in the afore-mentioned pairs, the challenge consists of indentifying the gene pairs that interact and those that don't interact.
