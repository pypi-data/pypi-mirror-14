prelude: >
    Starting with tempest-lib 1.0.0 the tempest-lib development has moved
    back into the tempest repository. After this release to get future
    code updates to tempest-lib code you need change your requirements
    to require tempest instead of tempest-lib and update your tepmest_lib
    imports to use tempest.lib instead.
deprecations:
  - Tempest-lib itself is deprecated. Development of the tempest library
    interface will occur in tempest in the future.
critical:
  - The 1.0.0 release is the last planned release for tempes-lib. All future
    development for the library interface will occur in tempest in the future.
