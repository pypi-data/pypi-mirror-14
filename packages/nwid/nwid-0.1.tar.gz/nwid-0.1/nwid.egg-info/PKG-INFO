        ----
        
        Please note that this is a work in progress. The API will likely change many
        times before it becomes stable. Use at your own risk.
        
        Nwid is a terminal widgets framework for humans.
        
        It is designed to be an easy-to-use, light-weight (no dependencies), terminal
        widget library and application framework for building terminal GUIs. It has
        intuitive widgets, a simple and recognizable event loop, and a container
        ``App`` that can be extended or used as-is. Its design and components take some
        inspiration from the well-known web browser DOM as well as the python packages
        `urwid <http://urwid.org/>`_ and
        `npyscreen <http://npyscreen.readthedocs.org/index.html>`_.
        
        Although there already are a handful of terminal user-interface libraries in
        python, I have found them to be either cumbersome to use or difficult to extend
        because of their design. The python curses module is itself unweildly and
        desperately needs a layer of abstraction to hide its unique details and oddly
        named functions. Nwid aims to be this intuitive, easy to extend abstraction
        layer. The nwid philosophy is to let you create and describe the widgets with
        intuitive attributes and methods, and the framework will take care of the
        cumbersome terminal details. The code is pythonic and easy to read, which makes
        it easy to extend.
        
        A low-level knowledge of terminals and tty is not necessary to using this
        framework. To get started, check out the examples in the examples directory.
        Nwid is designed to be conceptually easy to understand, and the examples are
        intended to exhibit the basic concepts in order to give a helpful overview of
        the capabilities and structure of the framework. After looking at the examples,
        you can read `Modules and Components`_ for more specific details about the
        framework.

        Modules and Components
        ======================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        The nwid framework is made of three major components, the ``App`` class for
        managing windows and running the event loop, the ``Window`` class for
        containing and managing widgets, and the widget module for creating the user
        interactive widgets (such as, textfields, labels, and dropdown boxes).
        
        The ``App`` is the base controller for the application. Besides controling the
        event loop, it is responsible for initializing the curses environment and
        handling the screen object. This class can be used as-is or may be extended by
        a custom class with application-specific controller methods. The ``App`` class
        has a special property, the ``App.window_stack``, that keeps track of the
        current window and any open window that has not yet been closed but is covered
        up (partly or completely) by the current window.
        
        For instance, the first window may be a form that has a button that opens a
        second window with a select box containing a list of options to choose from.
        The first window hasn't yet closed but is waiting for the second window to
        provide the user selected choice. At this point, the second window is the
        second and top-most window on the stack. Any events that are triggered are now
        given to this window. It may completely cover the first window or might only
        cover a portion of it being centered on the screen with the edges revealing the
        first window behind it. This second window may contain a select box with a list
        of several objects or strings to pass back to the first window. One of these
        options might be 'new', indicating that the user wishes to create a new string
        or object. Selecting this item, might open a third window for this task,
        putting this third window on top of the stack. This stacking could go on
        indefinitely with each window appending to the ``App.window_stack``. When the
        topmost window is closed, this window is 'popped' from the stack and the next
        window down in the stack is given back the focus. When an ``App`` no longer has
        any windows, the application is closed.
        
        The ``Window`` class is the container class for the widgets. It sets the bounds
        for where a widget can be drawn. It may have a border and title set. Note that
        this is not the same thing as the curses window object. Although it should have
        a reference to this object in ``Window.screen``.
        
        A widget is a user interface object that can be displayed in a window. It is
        defined by its height and width, its location on the window, and its foreground
        and background colors. It has contents such as a string of text or a more
        complicated widget may contain other widgets. In fact, a ``Window`` class is
        actually a special kind of top-level widget. You can create your own custom
        widgets by extending ``widget.Base``, although nwid comes with a number of
        useful generic widgets such as ``TextBox``, ``LabledTextBox``, ``CheckBox``,
        ``String``, ``Button``, ``Label``, and ``SelectBox``. Widgets can register
        events to callback functions in order to handle keyboard or mouse events.
        
        
        The App Module
        --------------
        
        The ``nwid.app`` module comprises
        
        
        The ``App`` controller is also responsible for the event loop that catches
        keyboard and mouse events. It passes these events to the window in focus
        (``App.window``) for the window to handle.
        
        Lastly, the ``App`` is responsible for setting up and tearing down the curses
        environment. It initializes the curses screen and binds this object to any
        window that is put in the window stack. This is done using a ``CursesManager``
        object, which is both a context manager and a wrapper for the curses library.
        This object is part of the nwid internals and generally doesn't need to be
        accessed directly. It takes care of the nitty-gritty details.
        
        The App Class
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``nwid.App`` class is the primary
        
        You can either use it as is or you can inherit from ``App``.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>>
        
        The current window or top-most window is always the window with the focus,
        meaning that any events that are triggered are given only to that window. The
        ``App.window`` attribute always points to this window. Setting this attribute
        to a new window will automatically make this new window the window with the
        focus and put it on top of the 'window stack'.
        
        
        
        Attributes
        ``````````
        
        Methods
        ```````
        
        The CursesManager Context Manager
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        TODO
        
        The Event Loop
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The event loop is inspired by the design of an Internet browser's event loop.
        
        Registering Events
        ``````````````````
        
        A widget can register an event with a callback function by
        
        Example:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> def widget.callback_function(self):
            >>>     print 'Event triggered!'
        
            >>> widget.register_event('x', widget.callback_function)
        
        Event Propagation
        `````````````````
        
        When an event is fired, the main window's trigger function is called with the
        event name. It then calls the trigger function of its child that has focus. If
        this child has a child widget, the process continues down until it gets to the
        lowest widget in focus that has no children. This widget attempts to run any
        registered callback functions. The function may return as normal and the parent
        regains control and attempts to run any registered callback function that it
        may have. This process continues until the main window regains control or if
        the exception ``PreventDefault`` is raised. A callback function may choose to
        raise ``PreventDefault`` in order to prevent other callback functions from
        interferring. This is very similar to JavaScript's ``Event.preventDefault()``
        method.
        
        
        
        Widget Module
        -------------
        
        A Widget is a reusable modular component that is displayed on the screen as a
        button, a text field, or other graphical interface. It can be combined to make
        a more complex widget component. The widgets that make up this more comlpex
        component are the ``children`` widgets to the ``parent`` widget.
        
        The ``parent`` widget is responsible for the layout of its ``children``. The
        ``parent`` controls the vertical and horizontal alignment as well as whether or
        not it has the ability to scroll.
        
        Base Widget
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``nwid.widget.Base`` class is the foundation for all other widgets. If you
        wish to create your own widget, you should inherit from ``Base``.
        
        For example:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>>
        
        String Widget
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``nwid.widget.String`` class is a basic string widget. This widget is used
        for displaying strings.
        
        TextBox Widget
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``nwid.widget.TextBox`` class is a textbox widget for accepting user input.
        
        ComboBox Widget
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``nwid.widget.ComboBox`` class is a textbox widget for accepting user input.
