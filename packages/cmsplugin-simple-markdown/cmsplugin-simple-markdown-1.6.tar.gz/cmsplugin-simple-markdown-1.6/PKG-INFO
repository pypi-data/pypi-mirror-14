        Simple Markdown plugin is just a simple markdown plugin for django-cms.
        It's brutally simple. Just a text area and you'll enter some markdown text and save it.
        And the reason why I make this is that, I really couldn't find any simple as stupid plugin
        for django-cms, all I've found was fancy with a lot of java script stuff.

        Configuration
        ==============
        
        Most people say that installation of ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown`` is easy, it seems they're out of space.
        It's fucking hard to install.
        
        Configuration & Usage
        ----------------------
        
        1. Make sure ``django-markdown`` is configured as described in their `Setup
        <https://github.com/klen/django_markdown#id5>`_ section.
        2. Add ``cmsplugin_simple_markdown`` to  ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        3. If you are using Django 1.7 or higher add ``'cmsplugin_simple_markdown': 'cmsplugin_simple_markdown.migrations_django',`` to ``MIGRATION_MODULES`` in settings.
        4. Create the database tables::
        
            $ python manage.py migrate
        
        
        This is not easy, It's hard, confusing. I doubt, double doubt that those people that keep saying installing this
        is easy are on something.
        
        
        Drama story
        ===========
        Since every application won't begins with love, this plugin has been developed to solve a problem.
        2 days back, I've been using **cms.plugin.text** for handling html pages and related content,
        but when I've tried to use AWS S3/CloudFront for my static files, I got stuck with ``CORS`` problem.
        So I've develop ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown`` to be used without any dependencies on JavaScript or CSS files.
        
        Now these days, people all around the world are using it, They are happy with it, They go crazy with ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown``,
        even they name their child ``cmsplugin-simple-markdown``, at least I did. ;)
