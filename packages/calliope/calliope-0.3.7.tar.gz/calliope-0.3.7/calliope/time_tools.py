time_tools.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides the TimeSummarizer class to dynamically adjust time resolution.

Also provides the masks_to_resolution_series function. A resolution series
is a pandas Series with the same index as the input data, where each
time step is one of:

* a positive integer (signifying how many timesteps to summarize),
* -1 (marks timesteps that will be summarized if following a positive integer,
  or dropped otherwise),
* or 0 (no resolution adjustment to this timestep).

The name of a resolution series must always be 'resolution_series'.
