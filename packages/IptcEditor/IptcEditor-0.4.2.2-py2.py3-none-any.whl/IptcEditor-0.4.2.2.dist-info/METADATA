=================
**Description**
=================


Please note, this is a very early beta ...

This is a python3 GTK3 wrapper for the EXIV2 application, used to read and edit IPTC image metadata.
This application can handle bulk operations on directories of image files.
Currently the application only allows *editing* of IPTC keywords (Iptc.Application2.Keyword).
However, all IPTC datasets may be *displayed* or *removed*.

============
**Features**
============

- Read and edit IPTC image metadata.
- Select to operate on a single image file, or do bulk operations on a directory of image files.
- Allows for complete removal of unrequired IPTC datasets.

===========
**Usage**
===========

- Either select a single image file, or a directory containing image files.
  This can be accomplished via either the "File" menu or the "Currently selected file or directory" field.
  Acceptable mime image types are: jpg, jpeg, tif, tiff, png, gif.

- The following functions are available:

  - Display Keywords (button): Shows all the keywords of the selected file(s).
  - Display Date Created (button): Shows all the "DateCreated" tags of the selected file(s).
  - Display IPTC Datasets (button): Shows all the IPTC tag types of the selected file(s).
  - Replace Keyword(s)

    - Tap in the "keyword to replace" field to bring up the list.
      Highlight the keyword to replace.
      Tap the "select" button.
    - Type the new keyword into the "New key phrase" field.
      Keywords may be selected from previously used by double-clicking from the list that appears in the action pane.
    - Tap the "Replace keyword(s) button to complete the change.

  - Add a new keyword:

    - Do as above (replacement), but leave the "keyword to replace" field empty.

  - Delete an existing keyword:

    - Do as above (replacement), but leave the "New keyword" field empty.

  - Remove IPTC dataset:

    - Type IPTC dataset identifier *exactly as it appears* into the "Remove IPTC Dataset" field.
    - Tap the "Remove IPTC Dataset" button.
