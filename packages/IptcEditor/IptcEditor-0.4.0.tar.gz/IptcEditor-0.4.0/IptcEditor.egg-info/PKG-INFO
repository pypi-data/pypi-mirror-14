        =================
        
        
        Please note, this is a very early beta ...
        
        This is a python3 GTK3 wrapper for the EXIV2 application, used to read and edit IPTC image metadata.
        This application can handle bulk operations on directories of image files.
        Currently the application only allows *editing* of IPTC keywords (Iptc.Application2.Keyword).
        However, all IPTC datasets may be *displayed* or *removed*.
