NOTE: Outdated instructions.
I don't mirror repo anymore, but try to keep 2 versions in sync manually.


Mirror bzr repo to git with fast-export/fast-import
***************************************************

1) cd bzr intelhex branch
2) bzr fast-export -b test-all-pythons . fastimport.stream
3) copy fastimport.stream to git checkout
4) ensure current git branch is test-all-pythons
5) git fast-import < fastimport.stream
6) checkout git master branch and merge test-all-pythons mirror there
7) push to github
