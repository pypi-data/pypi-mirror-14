Quick Start Guide
=================

1. Define your tags
-------------------

Inside your Markdown files, define tags at the end of header lines. By
default, the syntax for this is ``{#my-tag-here}``:

::

    # This is a header that I would like to make a tag for {#tag}

    You can also use Setext (underlined) style headers {#setext}
    ------------------------------------------------------------

The default is similar to `Pandoc's Markdown header
identifiers <http://pandoc.org/README.html#header-identifiers>`__

2. Use the tags as you would regular HTML anchors
-------------------------------------------------

Elsewhere, you can use the previously defined tags inlinks to provide a
direct path to the header:

::

    [This links back to the header using the AnchorHub tag 'tag'](#tag)

    [This one links to the Setext header](#setext)

3. Run AnchorHub on your Markdown files
---------------------------------------

``anchorhub`` will parse your Markdown files. You've got a few options
for running ``anchorhub``: run it on a single file, run it on a single
level of a directory, or run it on an entire directory tree.

::

    Single file use:
    $ anchorhub mytags.md

    Directory use (single level):
    $ anchorhub .

    Directory use (provided directory level and all subdirectories):
    $ anchorhub . -r

This will output your processed files in a new folder in your current
directory, 'anchorhub-out/'

4. Enjoy your (relatively) hassle-free GitHub anchor links
----------------------------------------------------------

Assuming all of the above Markdown was in a file named 'mytags.md', here
is what we'd find inside of 'anchorhub-out/mytags.md':

::

    # This is a header that I would like to make a tag for

    You can also use Setext (underlined) style headers
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    ...
    [This links back to the header using the AnchorHub tag 'tag'](#this-is-a-header-that-i-would-like-to-make-a-tag-for)

    [This one links to the Setext header](#you-can-also-use-setext-underlined-style-headers)
