# Django Any Backend #

DJANGO_ANY_BACKEND is designed to allow the use of models with non-database backends in Django. The first objective is to allow the use of all the Django Queryset API (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/models/querysets/) with these models so that they work with: 

* Django ModelForm
* Django built-in crud views (CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView, ListView and DetailView)
* Django ModelAdmin
* Django ModelSerializers (thus Django Rest Framework)

The second objective is to make it as simple as possible to implement a new custom backend by subclassing one class and providing the required crud functions. This was influenced by how custom backends can be implented in Flask.

A sample app using Pickle as a backend is included for demonstration and test purposes.

# Getting Started #

Import the django_any_backend Client object and override the key functions. There are two possible appraches for the write operations:

1.  Override create, update, delete (for individual objects) and get_pks. The default bulk functions will then loop through each object and run the required functions.
2.  Override create_bulk, delete_bulk and update_bulk. In this case the functions in option 1 are not required.

```python

from django_any_backend.client import Client

class CustomClient(Client):

    def setup(self, db_name):
        """
        Run every time connection to backend is made

        :param object: A dictionary of arguments to create the object with
        :return: PK: Primary key of object which was created. Should raise exception if object cannot be created

        return ids
```

In settings.py, add 'django_any_backend' to the list of installed apps,

Then add the custom client to the list of database backends:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    },
    'custom': {
        'ENGINE': 'django_any_backend.backends',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'custom'),
        'CLIENT': 'mycustombackend.client.CustomClient',
        'MIGRATIONS': False,
    }
}
```

You need to add a database router in settings.py (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/multi-db/#using-routers). Django_Any_Backend comes with one built-in which you can use by adding the following line to settings.py.

```python
DATABASE_ROUTERS = ['django_any_backend.routers.BackendRouter']
```

If using this router, it is required to mark which models to route to the custom backend. This is done by adding non_db and max_per_request attributes to each model which will use a custom non-db backend. Use the name of the backend as specified above in the DATABASES attribute of settings.py.

In models.py:

```python
class Artist(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, null=True)
    type = models.IntegerField(choices=((0, 'Solo'), (1, 'Group')))
    genre = models.CharField(max_length=15)

    non_db = 'custom'
    max_per_request = 100

```

If max_per_request is set, big list requests will be broken up into chunks.

To enable migrations it is required to implement Introspection and Schema modules. Obviously not required if the backend is a remote api. Information about other features will be added soon, for now check out the example called testapp.
