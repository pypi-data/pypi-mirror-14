Description: TikZ in readthedocs.org
        =======================
        
        This package contains binary files (executables and libraries) that are needed
        for `sphinxcontrib-tikz` package but are missing from readthedocs.org. This
        enables documentations created with Sphinx to use TikZ drawings at
        readthedocs.org.
        
        To enable the TikZ support at readthedocs.org, add `rtd-tikz` to the
        requirements file used by readthedocs.org. It will install `sphinxcontrib-tikz`
        as a dependency.

        **WARNING:** You probably want to install this package into a virtual
        environment, otherwise you may accidentally overwrite your system binaries if
        you have them.
        
        **NOTE:** If you install `rtd-tikz` (i.e., `sphinxcontrib-tikz`) into a virtual
         environment, you should install `sphinx` into that virtual environment too. The
         system installation won't find the extensions that exist in the virtual
         environment.
