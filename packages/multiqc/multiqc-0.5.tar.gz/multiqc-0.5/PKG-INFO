Description: 
        MultiQC is a tool to aggregate bioinformatics results across many samples into a single report. It is written in Python and contains modules for a number of common tools (FastQC, Bowtie, Picard and many others).
        
        You can install MultiQC from PyPI as follows::
        
            pip install multiqc
        
        Then it's just a case of going to your analysis directory and running the script::
        
            multiqc .
        
        MultiQC will scan the specified directory (:code:`'.'` is the current dir) and produce a report detailing whatever it finds.
        
        The report is created in :code:`multiqc_report.html` by default. Tab-delimited data files are created in :code:`multiqc_data/` to give easy access for downstream processing.
        
        For more detailed instructions, run :code:`multiqc -h` or see the MultiQC website at http://multiqc.info
