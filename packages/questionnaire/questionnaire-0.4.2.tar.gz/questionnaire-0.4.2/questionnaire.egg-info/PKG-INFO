Description: # questionnaire
        
        __questionnaire__ is a Python library that uses [pick](https://github.com/wong2/pick) to prompt a user to answer a series of questions. At the end of the questionnaire if returns the answers as a dict.
        
        As with __pick__, __questionnaire__ supports multiple choice questions only. However, __questionnaire__ allows users to select multiple options for a single question.
        
        __questionnaire__'s most powerful feature is the ability to include any question conditionally based on previous answers. The API for conditional questions is simple and flexible.
          
        Finally, users can use <kbd>&larr;</kbd> or <kbd>h</kbd> to go back in a questionnaire.
        
        ## Installation
        ```sh
        pip install questionnaire
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        Check out [this client](examples/client.py) that uses __questionnaire__ to build up a dict of answers for easy generating an `ansible-playbook` command for administering servers.
