title: OpenStack L3 North-South Cross-AZ Performance

description:
  This scenario launches 1 pair of VMs on different compute nodes. VMs are in
  the different networks connected via different routers, master accesses slave
  by floating ip

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south.hot
  accommodation: [pair, single_room, zones: [nova, vcenter], cross_az, compute_nodes: 2]
