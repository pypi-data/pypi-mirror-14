##Siya Library Management Software

###History
I started writing this software while volunteering at Nepal Japn children Library in 2015. The library, at the time, used to enter their data into a spreadsheet software and make multiple copies for storage and backup. The problem with this approach was that it was difficult to search for books, it was difficult to modify the data since the data was stored in multiple places which weren't governed by any central system.

###Focus
Siya is focused on the four things listed below ( not in order of precedence )

* Easy to understand interface
* Portability
* Easily modifiable
* Easy to setup

###Technical Details
Siya 1.0
     This version is written in python using the django web framework as it's backend. It uses the default django server to host the site on a local computer since only a few computers (at most 10) use the system at a time.
