This is a commandline interface to build SASS projects using `libsass`_.

Alike the Compass commandline, there is 'build' and 'watch' actions to build all SASS files.

.. Warning::
    This is under construction, almost an Alpha for now.

.. Note::
    Old SASS syntax (the *indented syntax*) is not totally supported and actually this is not really planned to do it.
