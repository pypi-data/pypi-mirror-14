Backend values patchs
=====================

Patchs are used to modify given settings items like expanding paths. Backends
inherit from ``SettingsPatcher`` to be able to use it in their ``clean()``
method.

Todo:
    Should be named postprocess.SettingsPostProcessor because it contains
    patchs but will contain some validations soon.
