Description: # Sieve git push deployment
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mheistermann/sieve-git-pushdeploy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mheistermann/sieve-git-pushdeploy)
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Keep your sieve scripts in a git repos (e.g. on your mailserver), push
        to them to deploy a new version.
        
        Warning: experimental, use at your own risk. Probably quite buggy, just hacked
        this together quickly.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Installation with pip
        
        ```pip3 install sieve-git-pushdeploy```
        
        ### Installation without pip
        
        ```
        virtualenv -p python2 .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        Copy the provided example copy to `~/.config/sieve-git-pushdeploy/sieve.conf`
        and adjust the values.
        
        Somewhere,
        ```
        HOOK=path/to/sieve-git-pushdeploy/.venv/bin/sieve-git-pushdeploy
        
        git init --bare sieve.git
        cd sieve.git/hooks
        ln -s $HOOK post-receive
        ln -s $HOOK update
        ```
        You can also opt to only use a subset of the hooks.
        
        Now if you clone that repo and push your configs to it, they will be checked
        and uploaded automatically.

        ## Ideas
        
        * when checkscript() fails, report the error - need to improve sievelib
        * Proper installation with pip?
        * Option to reject pushes with invalid syntax?
        * Colored output that stands out from the rest of the git output
        * Update sievelib to Python3, use Python3
