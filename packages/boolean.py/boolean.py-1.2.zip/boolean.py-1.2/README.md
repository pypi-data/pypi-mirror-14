boolean.py
==========

"boolean.py" is a small library implementing a boolean algebra. It
defines two base elements, TRUE and FALSE, and a class Symbol which can take
on one of these two values. Calculations are done in terms of AND, OR and
NOT - other compositions like XOR and NAND are not implemented.
It runs on Python 2.7 and Python 3.
