You can also build manually from the source for more control. First obtain a
copy of the source by either downloading the
`zipball <https://github.com/martinpengellyphillips/flattener/archive/master.zip>`_
or cloning the public repository::

    git clone git@github.com:martinpengellyphillips/flattener.git

Then you can build and install the package into your current Python
site-packages folder::

    python setup.py install

Alternatively, just build locally and manage yourself::

    python setup.py build

Building documentation from source

To build the documentation from source::

    python setup.py build_sphinx

Then view in your browser::

    file:///path/to/flattener/build/doc/html/index.html
