Lomb-Scargle Periodogram
========================

One of the best known methods for detecting periodicity in unevenly-sampled
time series is the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram. ``gatspy`` has three main
implementations of the classic periodogram:

:class:`~gatspy.periodic.LombScargle`
  This basic method uses simple linear algebra to compute the periodogram.
  Though it is relatively slow, the approach allows for some enhancements such
  as floating mean, multiple Fourier terms, and regularization terms.

:class:`~gatspy.periodic.LombScargleFast` 
  This class implements the fast, O[N logN] implementation of the Lomb-Scargle
  periodogram. It is much faster than either of the below methods, especially
  as the number of data points and frequencies increases. It is limited to
  either a simple pre-centered model or a floating mean model, and the
  frequencies must be computed on a regular grid.

:class:`~gatspy.periodic.LombScargleAstroML`
  This class depends on the Lomb-Scargle implementation in
  `astroML <http://www.astroml.org>`_. This is a cython implementation, and
  is slightly faster than :class:`~gatspy.periodic.LombScargle`, though it
  does not handle higher-order fits or regularization. It is mainly implemented
  for the sake of unit testing.

For the basic no-frills Lomb-Scargle algorithm, the best option to use is
:class:`~gatspy.periodic.LombScargleFast`. Keep in mind that aside from
options used at model instantiation, the API of the three is identical.

API of Periodic Models
----------------------
The periodogram models here follow in the vein of the
`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_ API, which makes clear the separation
between several parts of the problem:

- the choice of model: this happens at class instantiation.
- the fitting of the model to data: this happens with the ``fit()`` method.
- the application of the model to new data: this happens with the ``predict()``
  method.
- the evaluation of the model fit: this happens with the ``score()`` method.

The models in ``gatspy`` differ from those in ``scikit-learn`` in several
important ways:

1. The ``fit()`` method optionally accepts errors in the magnitude inputs.
   For multiband methods, the fit method also accepts a specification of the
   filter/band in which the magnitude is observed.
2. The ``predict()`` and ``score()`` methods require specification of a period.
   If this period is not supplied, the best period will be found automatically
   via an exhaustive grid search, which can be very slow for some models and/or
   datasets!

We'll see examples of this below.

Basic Lomb-Scargle Periodogram
------------------------------
We'll start by looking at the basic Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, using the
:class:`~gatspy.periodic.LombScargleFast` model.
Let's start by loading one r-band RR Lyrae lightcurve using the
:func:`gatspy.datasets.fetch_rrlyrae` function, which is discussed more fully
in :ref:`datasets`.

.. ipython::

    In [1]: from gatspy import datasets, periodic

    In [2]: rrlyrae = datasets.fetch_rrlyrae()

    In [3]: lcid = rrlyrae.ids[0]

    In [4]: t, mag, dmag, filts = rrlyrae.get_lightcurve(lcid)

    In [5]: mask = (filts == 'r')

    In [6]: t_r, mag_r, dmag_r = t[mask], mag[mask], dmag[mask]

Given this data, we'd like to determine the best period using the periodogram.
This can be done using the ``find_best_period`` method of any of the above
estimators, once the ``period_range`` attribute of the optimizer is set
(see discussion below).

Let's quickly demonstrate this with :class:`~gatspy.periodic.LombScargleFast`.
Because our data is from an RR Lyrae star, we'll set a conservative period
range of 0.2 to 1.2 days to make sure it contains the true period:

.. ipython::

    In [7]: model = periodic.LombScargleFast(fit_period=True)

    In [8]: model.optimizer.period_range = (0.2, 1.2)

    In [9]: model.fit(t_r, mag_r, dmag_r);
    Finding optimal frequency:
     - Estimated peak width = 0.00189
     - Using 5 steps per peak; omega_step = 0.000378
     - User-specified period range:  0.2 to 1.2
     - Computing periods at 69190 steps
    Zooming-in on 5 candidate peaks:
     - Computing periods at 995 steps

Now the best period is found in the ``best_period`` attribute of the model:

.. ipython::

    @doctest float
    In [10]: model.best_period
    Out[10]: 0.61431661211675215

The periodogram optimizer uses a two-step grid search, first searching a
relatively coarse grid to find several candidate frequencies, and finally
zooming-in on these to compute the observed period to high precision.
Let's see how close this period is to the period measured by Sesar 2010
using template fits:

.. ipython::

    In [11]: metadata = rrlyrae.get_metadata(lcid)

    In [12]: true_period = metadata['P']

    @doctest float
    In [13]: true_period
    Out[13]: 0.61431831

The two periods differ to about :math:`10^{-6}` days, or approximately one tenth
of a second. To see more about what is going on in the periodogram, let's plot
the Lomb-Scargle periodogram as a function of period:

.. plot::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib as mpl

    mpl.style.use('ggplot')
    mpl.rc('axes', color_cycle=["#4C72B0", "#55A868", "#C44E52",
                                "#8172B2", "#CCB974"])

    # Fetch the RRLyrae data
    from gatspy import datasets, periodic
    rrlyrae = datasets.fetch_rrlyrae()

    # Select r-band data from the first lightcurve
    lcid = rrlyrae.ids[0]
    t, mag, dmag, filts = rrlyrae.get_lightcurve(lcid)
    mask = (filts == 'r')
    t_r, mag_r, dmag_r = t[mask], mag[mask], dmag[mask]

    # Fit the Lomb-Scargle model
    model = periodic.LombScargleFast()
    model.fit(t_r, mag_r, dmag_r)

    # Compute the scores on a grid of periods
    periods = np.linspace(0.3, 0.9, 10000)

    import warnings
    with warnings.catch_warnings():
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
        scores = model.score(periods)

    # Plot the results
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))
    fig.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.2)
    ax.plot(periods, scores)
    ax.set(xlabel='period (days)', ylabel='Lomb Scargle Power',
           xlim=(0.3, 0.9), ylim=(0, 1))

We see here why so many steps are needed to find the optimal period: the width
of each of these peaks is so small that a coarser grid might easily miss a
significant peak!

The Lomb-Scargle model is essentially a least squares fit of a single sinusoid
to the data; we can see the model fit using the ``predict`` method of the
periodic model:

.. ipython::

    In [14]: import numpy as np

    In [15]: tfit = np.linspace(0, model.best_period, 4)

    @doctest float
    In [16]: model.predict(tfit)
    Out[16]: array([ 17.03381525,  17.02560232,  17.37830128,  17.03381525])

Let's take a look at this model plotted over the phased data:

.. plot::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib as mpl

    mpl.style.use('ggplot')
    mpl.rc('axes', color_cycle=["#4C72B0", "#55A868", "#C44E52",
                                "#8172B2", "#CCB974"])

    # Fetch the RRLyrae data
    from gatspy import datasets, periodic
    rrlyrae = datasets.fetch_rrlyrae()

    # Get data from first lightcurve
    lcid = rrlyrae.ids[0]
    t, mag, dmag, filts = rrlyrae.get_lightcurve(lcid)
    mask = (filts == 'r')
    t_r, mag_r, dmag_r = t[mask], mag[mask], dmag[mask]

    # Fit the Lomb-Scargle model
    model = periodic.LombScargleFast()
    model.fit(t_r, mag_r, dmag_r)
    model.optimizer.period_range = (0.2, 1.2)

    # Predict on a regular phase grid
    period = model.best_period
    tfit = np.linspace(0, period, 1000)
    magfit = model.predict(tfit)

    # Plot the results
    phase = (t_r / period) % 1
    phasefit = (tfit / period)
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.errorbar(phase, mag_r, dmag_r, fmt='o')
    ax.plot(phasefit, magfit, '-', color='gray')
    ax.set(xlabel='phase', ylabel='r magnitude')
    ax.invert_yaxis()

The model is clearly not a good fit for the data (RR Lyrae are much more
complicated than a simple sine wave!) but the model serves a useful
purpose: it gives us an accurate period determination: the key is that although
the sine wave is not a good fit to the data, it is a *much better fit* at the
correct period than it is at the incorrect period.
    

Configuring the Optimizer
-------------------------
Finding the best period requires use of an optimizer. For typical optimization
problems, this is done using some sort of automated minimization scheme such as
gradient descent, or perhaps via a Bayesian sampling scheme such as MCMC.
Unfortunately, these typical methods fail because there are so many peaks in
the periodogram frequency. Typically periodogram studies fall back on a brute
force search grid, finding the grid point which maximizes the power/score.

A brute force search has two parameters that must be specified: the
**range of the grid**, and the **step spacing of the grid**.

The **range of the grid** must be chosen based on your intuition about the data.
Often people wrongly think they can use some sort of Nyquist-type limit to
choose a search range (i.e. evaluating based on the minimum or mean time
between subsequent observations); unfortunately this line of reasoning does
not apply, even approximately, to unequally-spaced observations.
This can't be stressed enough, as such misuse of Nyquist-type arguments comes
up often in the literature: **The periodogram of an unequally-spaced time
series is generally sensitive to periods far smaller than the minimum time
between observations.** Thus the search range is an entirely free parameter,
which must be set by the user based on intuition about the data, and in gatspy
is set via the ``model.optimizer.period_range`` parameter.

The **spacing of the grid** is easier to determine automatically. The grid
spacing must be much smaller than the width a typical periodogram peak, or
you risk entirely missing peaks within the scan. The typical width of a
periodogram peak is inversely proportional to the **range** of the data; that
is, if the first observation is at :math:`t_{min}` and the last observation is
at :math:`t_{max}`, then the peak width *in frequency* is approximately

.. math::

   \Delta f = 2\pi/(t_{max} - t_{min}).

The grid should be chosen such that multiple grid poins cover each potential
peak, so we need to choose an oversampling factor (say, 5) and compute the
grid based on this.

We can see all of this in play when we ask the model for the best period.
Since we're looking at RR Lyrae which have typical periods of around 0.5 days,
we'll choose a range around this.
Note that the units of ``period_range`` should match the units of the times
passed to the ``fit()`` algorithm. Here the input times are in days, so the
``period_range`` is specified as ``(min_period, max_period)`` in days:

.. ipython::

    In [17]: model = periodic.LombScargleFast(fit_period=True)

    In [18]: model.optimizer.period_range = (0.2, 1.2)

    In [19]: model.fit(t_r, mag_r, dmag_r);

    In [20]: model.best_period
    Out[20]: 0.61431661211675215

These values can be adjusted via the ``optimizer`` argument to the model; this
can be done either at or after instantiation. After instantiation is the
preferred pattern for the default optimizer:

.. ipython::

    In [21]: model = periodic.LombScargleFast(fit_period=True)

    In [22]: model.optimizer.set(period_range=(0.5, 0.7), first_pass_coverage=10)

    In [23]: model.fit(t_r, mag_r, dmag_r);

    In [24]: model.best_period
    Out[24]: 0.61430890466467969

Before you do any period optimization, be sure to set these quantities
appropriately! And note that becuase the grid spacing is equal in frequency,
probing small periods (high frequencies) is much more expensive than probing
large periods (small frequencies).
