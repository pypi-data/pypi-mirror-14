Datasets (``gatspy.datasets``)
******************************

``gatspy`` provides several observed and simulated datasets for use with the
time series tools in the package. The functionality contained in this module
uses utilities which download and cache the data the first time the commands
are run, and uses the cached results for any subsequent calls.
