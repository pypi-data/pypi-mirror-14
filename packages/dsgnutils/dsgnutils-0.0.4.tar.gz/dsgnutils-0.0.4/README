DOCUMENTATION COMING SOON -- THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY A DRAFT

GOALS:

    These are utilities that make python nice for me.  I heavily use almost all
    of them.  It is very likely that most of my other projects heavily depend
    on this bag 'o relatively simple tricks.  For spike projects, I just import
    everything, which also means I get everything in always.py (e.g.
    re,json,sys,os) for free.  Its not for everyone :D

ASSUMPTIONS:

    general:
        --  you use linux everywhere (this is not designed for portability)
        --  you will run dsgnutils nosetests (from source, make test, or make
            webtest) to figure out if it all seems to be working for you (was
            written for and tested on on ubuntu 14.04)

    F_Lock (Don't use this yet ... am trying to find a way to lock sqlite
    databases to avoid installing a whole dbms for simple web interfaces, but
    flocks are somewhat complicated, so not sure this is bug free):
        in your infrastructure, all linux machines have kernel version > x.y.z
        in your infrastructure, all linux machines have NFS version > x.y.z

    writeXGPL:
        you use git for your version control
