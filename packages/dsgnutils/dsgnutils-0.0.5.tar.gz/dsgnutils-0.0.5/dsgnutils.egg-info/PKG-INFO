        DOCUMENTATION COMING SOON -- THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY A DRAFT
        
        GOALS:
        
            These are utilities that make python nice for me.  I heavily use almost all
            of them.  It is very likely that most of my other projects heavily depend
            on this bag 'o relatively simple tricks.  For spike projects, I just import
            everything, which also means I get everything in always.py (e.g.
            re,json,sys,os) for free.  Its not for everyone :D
        
        ASSUMPTIONS:
        
            general:
                --  you use linux everywhere (this is not designed for portability)
                --  you will run dsgnutils nosetests (from source, make test, or make
                    webtest) to figure out if it all seems to be working for you (was
                    written for and tested on on ubuntu 14.04)
        
            F_Lock (Don't use this yet ... am trying to find a way to lock sqlite
            databases to avoid installing a whole dbms for simple web interfaces, but
            flocks are somewhat complicated, so not sure this is bug free):
                in your infrastructure, all linux machines have kernel version > x.y.z
                in your infrastructure, all linux machines have NFS version > x.y.z
        
            writeXGPL:
                you use git for your version control
