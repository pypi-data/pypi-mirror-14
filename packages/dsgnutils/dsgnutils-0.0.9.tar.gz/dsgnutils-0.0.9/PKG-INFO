        DOCUMENTATION COMING SOON -- THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY A DRAFT
        
        GOALS:
        
            These are utilities that make python 3.4.3 nice for me.  Its probably not
            for you.  :D
        
        ASSUMPTIONS:
        
            general:
                --  You understand that all bets are off with a major version of zero
                --  You love debian (this is not designed for portability)
                    --  tested in ubuntu 14.04, and used in ubuntu 12.04 vms by author
                --  you use python 3.4.3 or can altinstall and use it
                --  you will run dsgnutils nosetests (from source, make test, or make
                    webtest) to figure out if it all seems to be working for you (was
                    written for and tested on on ubuntu 14.04)
                    --  NB: nosetests-capturestderr currently has an import problem
                        which we patch via bin/reinstall.sh from the git repo for this
                        module
        
            F_Lock:
                --  really...don't use this yet ... am trying to find a way to lock
                    sqlite databases.  Some friends of mine and I are fond of sqlite
                    because it avoids installing a whole dbms for simple applications,
                    but flocks turn out to be somewhat complicated, so not sure this is
                    bug free or even the right way to go ... still having a play with
                    it
                --  notes 2 self:
                    --  in your infrastructure, all linux machines have kernel version
                        > x.y.z
                    --  in your infrastructure, all linux machines have NFS version >
                        x.y.z
