        To you, for using the library, for helping me to make it faster and better, for
        learn with it and for releasing your code to make the knowledge and the science
        open for the rest of humanity.
        
        
        Warning
        =======
        
        It has been developed with only python 3.5.X in mind, so it won't probably work
        on lower versions (i.e. no python 2.X support).
        
        Second warning
        ==============
        
        English included in both this document and the code can be devastating for the
        brain of an average human being. Even so we, the poor developers, are working
        hard to write as correctly as possible and learn along the way. The
        documentation will be updated as we improve our language proficency as well as
        we receive critical / suggestions for this.
