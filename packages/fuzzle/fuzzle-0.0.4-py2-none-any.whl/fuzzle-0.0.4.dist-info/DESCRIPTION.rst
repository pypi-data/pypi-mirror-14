Thanks
======

To you, for using the library, for helping me to make it faster and better, for
learn with it and for releasing your code to make the knowledge and the science
open for the rest of humanity.


Warning
=======

It has been developed with only python 3.5.X in mind, so it won't probably work
on lower versions (i.e. no python 2.X support).

Second warning
==============

English included in both this document and the code can be devastating for the
brain of an average human being. Even so we, the poor developers, are working
hard to write as correctly as possible and learn along the way. The
documentation will be updated as we improve our language proficency as well as
we receive critical / suggestions for this.
