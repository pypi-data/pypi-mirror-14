tumdlr (Tumblr Downloader)
==========================

|Scrutinizer Code Quality|

Introduction
============

Tumdlr is a command line application for generating and maintaining
Tumblr blog archives.

It works almost entirely using Tumblr's own
`API <https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2>`__ instead of relying on
web scraping methods, offering vastly superior performance without the
risk of breaking with future site updates.

This application is currently in pre-alpha status and currently only
supports archiving photo posts with limited configuration options
available.

Features
--------

Tumdlr currently supports archiving the following types of posts: \*
Photos (including linked photos) \* Videos (support for external video
embeds, such as YouTube, is provided via
`youtube-dl <https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/>`__) \* Audio \* Text /
regular posts (in both plain text and HTML)

In addition to, Tumdlr is able to track and update previously archiving
blogs without needing to re-download existing posts.
