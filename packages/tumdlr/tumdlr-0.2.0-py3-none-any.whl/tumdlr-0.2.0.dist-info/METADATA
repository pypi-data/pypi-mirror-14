tumdlr (Tumblr Downloader)
==========================

|Scrutinizer Code Quality|

Introduction
============

Tumdlr is a command line application for generating and maintaining
Tumblr blog archives.

It works almost entirely using Tumblr's own
`API <https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2>`__ instead of relying on
web scraping methods, offering vastly superior performance without the
risk of breaking with future site updates.

This application is currently in pre-alpha status.

Features
--------

Tumdlr currently supports archiving the following types of posts:

-  Photos (including linked photos)
-  Videos (including support for most external video embeds, such as
   YouTube) - Powered via
   `youtube-dl <https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/>`__
-  [STRIKEOUT:Audio] (Coming soon)
-  [STRIKEOUT:Text / regular posts (in both plain text and HTML)]
   (Coming soon)

Installation
------------

Tumdlr can be easily installed with pip:

::

    $ pip install tumdlr

Usage
-----

Online documentation is not available during alpha development.
Available commands can be found by running the ``tumdlr --help``
command.
