##
## Tumblr authentication information
## ---
## Tumdlr heavily utilizes Tumblr's own developer API to function. All general post metadata is retrieved using this
## API, so a valid API key *must* be provided in order for the application to function. By default, the public API
## key is provided. If possible, it is recommended you not rely on this API key, and instead obtain your own by
## registering a Tumblr application here: https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps
##
#[Auth]
#ApiKey = fuiKNFp9vQFvjLNvx4sUwti4Yb5yGutBN4Xh10LXZhhRKjWlV4
