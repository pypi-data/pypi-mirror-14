Description: YAEP - Yet Another Environment Package
        ======================================
        
        As the name says, this package enters the crowded field of 
        environment related packages.  The main goal of this package
        is to provide you with the ability to populate your
        environment with a a source (by default reading a .env file)
        and then use a simple function in your configuration files
        to read these values or use defaults.
        
        It's worth noting that this software is under active
        development and interfaces will change without warning.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Usage is simple. Early in the execution of your project, or
        in a dedicated module for configuration, import `populate_env`
        from the yaep package.  Running this will populate your
        environment with values from your .env file.  You can
        alternatively set the env_file argument or the ENV_FILE
        environment variable to read from another env file.
        
            from yaev import populate_env
            populate_env()
        
        Now you can setup your configuration. For example, in a
        settings.py or config.py:
        
            from yaev import env
            DATABASE_URL = env('DATABASE_URL', 'sqlite://:memory:')
        
        The env function has a few other useful tricks.  For example,
        allowing for a default that is "sticky" - meaning if it is
        employed it is set in the environment.
        
            os.getenv('foo')  # Returns None
            FOO = env('FOO', 'bar', sticky=True)
            os.getenv('FOO')  # Returns 'bar'
        
        Additionally, you can by default allow for boolean-like values
        to be changed to booleans on the fly.
        
            os.getenv('SOMETHING')  # Returns 'True'
            env('SOMETHING')  # Returns True
        
        By default a case-insensitive comparison to 'True' and 'False'
        is done, along with 1 and 0.  You can change the available
        values by passing in a new boolean map:
        
            env('pony', boolean_map={True: ['True', '1', 'Pony']})
            # Returns True
        
        On the subject of 1s and 0s - you might consider that if
        you are intending to get an integer that you will instead
        end up with 'True' or 'False' - you can overcome this by
        setting convert_booleans to False.  Additionally, you can
        cast your return value explicitly by setting the type_class,
        though note that if convert_booleans is True that will
        override your type_class.  Some examples:
        
            # SOMETHING is set to '1' in the environment
            env('SOMETHING') # Returns True
            env('SOMETHING', convert_booleans=False) # Returns '1'
            env('SOMETHING', convert_booleans=False, type_class=int) # Returns 1
        
        Finally, you can also raise an exception if a value is not
        set in your environment:
        
            env('IMPORTANT', default=yaep.exceptions.UnsetException)
            # Raises yaep.exceptions.UnsetException
        
        
        Using Other Environment Sources
        -------------------------------
        
        A goal of the project is to be able to override or add to the
        default of pulling values in from an env file. Supporting
        alternate sources such as credential servers is the goal.
        
        Work in this area is slated for a future release.
