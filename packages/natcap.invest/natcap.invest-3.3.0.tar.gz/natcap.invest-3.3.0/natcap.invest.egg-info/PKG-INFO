        About  InVEST
        =============
        
        InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is a family
        of tools for quantifying the values of natural capital in clear, credible, and
        practical ways. In promising a return (of societal benefits) on investments in
        nature, the scientific community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to
        quantify and forecast this return. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify
        the importance of natural capital, to assess the tradeoffs associated with
        alternative choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.
        
        Older versions of InVEST ran as script tools in the ArcGIS ArcToolBox environment,
        but have almost all been ported over to a purely open-source python environment.
        
        InVEST is licensed under a permissive, modified BSD license.

        Installing InVEST
        =================
        
        Python Dependencies
        -------------------
        
        Dependencies for ``natcap.invest`` are listed in ``requirements.txt``:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            Pyro4>=4.41
            gdal>=1.11.2,<2.0
            h5py>=2.3.0
            matplotlib
            natcap.versioner>=0.2.4
            numpy>=1.10.2rc1
            pyamg>=2.2.1
            pygeoprocessing>=0.3.0a14
            rtree>=0.8.2
            scipy>=0.14.0
            shapely
            setuptools>=8.0
        
        Additionally, ``PyQt4`` is required to use the ``invest`` cli, but is not
        required for development against ``natcap.invest``.
        
        Installing from Source
        ----------------------
        
        If you have a compiler installed and configured for your system, and
        dependencies installed, the easiest way to install InVEST as a python package 
        is:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install natcap.invest
        
        If you are working within virtual environments, there is a `documented issue
        with namespaces 
        <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issues/250/develop-and-install-single-version>`__
        in setuptools that may cause problems when importing packages within the
        ``natcap`` namespace.  The current workaround is to use these extra pip flags:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install natcap.invest --egg --no-binary :all:
        
        Installing the latest development version
        -----------------------------------------
        
        The latest development version of InVEST can be installed from our source tree:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/natcap/invest@develop
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To run an InVEST model from the command-line, use the ``invest`` cli single
        entry point:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ invest --help
            usage: invest [-h] [--version] [--list] [model]

            positional arguments:
              model       The model/tool to run. Use --list to show available
                          models/tools. Identifiable model prefixes may also be used.
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help  show this help message and exit
              --version   show program's version number and exit
              --list      List available models
        
        To list the available models:
        
        .. code-block:: console

        Changes
        =======
        
        3.3.0 (2016-03-14)
        ------------------
        * Refactored Wind Energy model to use a CSV input for wind data instead of a Binary file.
        * Redesigned InVEST recreation model for a single input streamlined interface, advanced analytics, and refactored outputs.  While the model is still based on "photo user days" old model runs are not backward compatable with the new model or interface. See the Recreation Model user's guide chapter for details.
            * The refactor of this model requires an upgrade to ``GDAL >=1.11.0 <2.0`` and ``numpy >= 1.10.2``.
        * Removed nutrient retention (water purification) model from InVEST suite and replaced it with the nutrient delivery ratio (NDR) model.  NDR has been available in development relseases, but has now officially been added to the set of Windows Start Menu models and the "under development" tag in its users guide has been removed.  See the InVEST user's guide for details between the differences and advantages of NDR over the old nutrient model.
        * Modified NDR by adding a required "Runoff Proxy" raster to the inputs.  This allows the model to vary the relative intensity of nutrient runoff based on varying precipitation variability.
        * Fixed a bug in the Area Change rule of the Rule-Based Scenario Generator, where units were being converted incorrectly. (Issue `#3472 <https://bitbucket.org/natcap/invest/issues/3472>`_) Thanks to Fosco Vesely for this fix.
        * InVEST Seasonal Water Yield model released.
        * InVEST Forest Carbon Edge Effect model released.
        * InVEST Scenario Generator: Proximity Based model released and renamed the previous "Scenario Generator" to "Scenario Generator: Rule Based".
        * Implemented a blockwise exponential decay kernel generation function, which is now used in the Pollination and Habitat Quality models.
        * GLOBIO now uses an intensification parameter and not a map to average all agriculture across the GLOBIO 8 and 9 classes.
        * GLOBIO outputs modified so core outputs are in workspace and intermediate outputs are in a subdirectory called 'intermediate_outputs'.
        * Fixed a crash with the NDR model that could occur if the DEM and landcover maps were different resolutions.
        * Refactored all the InVEST model user interfaces so that Workspace defaults to the user's home "Documents" directory.
        * Fixed an HRA bug where stessors with a buffer of zero were being buffered by 1 pixel
        * HRA enhancement which creates a common raster to burn all input shapefiles onto, ensuring consistent alignment.
        * Fixed an issue in SDR model where a landcover map that was smaller than the DEM would create extraneous "0" valued cells.
        * New HRA feature which allows for "NA" values to be entered into the "Ratings" column for a habitat / stressor pair in the Criteria Ratings CSV. If ALL ratings are set to NA, the habitat / stressor will be treated as having no interaction. This means in the model, that there will be no overlap between the two sources. All rows parameters with an NA rating will not be used in calculating results.
        * Refactored Coastal Blue Carbon model for greater speed, maintainability and clearer documentation.
        * Habitat Quality bug fix when given land cover rasters with different pixel sizes than threat rasters. Model would use the wrong pixel distance for the convolution kernel.
        * Light refactor of Timber model. Now using CSV input attribute file instead of DBF file.
        * Fixed clipping bug in Wave Energy model that was not properly clipping polygons correctly. Found when using global data.
        * Made the following changes / updates to the coastal vulnerability model:
            * Fixed a bug in the model where the geomorphology ranks were not always being used correctly.
            * Removed the HTML summary results output and replaced with a link to a dashboard that helps visualize and interpret CV results.
            * Added a point shapefile output: 'outputs/coastal_exposure.shp' that is a shapefile representation of the corresponding CSV table.
            * The model UI now requires the 'Relief' input. No longer optional.
            * CSV outputs and Shapefile outputs based on rasters now have x, y coorinates of the center of the pixel instead of top left of the pixel.
        * Turning setuptools' zip_safe to False for consistency across the Natcap Namespace.
        * GLOBIO no longer requires user to specify a keyfield in the AOI.
        * New feature to GLOBIO to summarize MSA by AOI.
        * New feature to GLOBIO to use a user defined MSA parameter table to do the MSA thresholds for infrastructure, connectivity, and landuse type
        * Documentation to the GLOBIO code base including the large docstring for 'execute'.
