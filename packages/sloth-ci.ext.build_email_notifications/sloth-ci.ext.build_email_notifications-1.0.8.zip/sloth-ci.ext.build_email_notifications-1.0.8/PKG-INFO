Description: Send email notifications when builds complete or fail.
        
        Executing actions of an app is called *build*. A build is considered *completed* if all its actions were completed. If some actions were completed and some failed, it's a *partially completed*; if all actions fail, the build *failed*.
        
        This extension sends you emails via SMTP when your builds complete (fully or partially) or fail; just pick the desired notification level, list the recepient emails, and enter your SMTP credentials. Optionally, you can set the subject for each notifcation level.
        
        .. warning::
        
            This extension uses `SMTPHandler <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#smtphandler>`__ from logging.handlers. SMTPHandler doesn't work with GMail because it creates an smtplib.SMTP object to connect to the host, whereas GMail requires smtplib.SMTP_SSL.
        
            Outlook.com works fine.
