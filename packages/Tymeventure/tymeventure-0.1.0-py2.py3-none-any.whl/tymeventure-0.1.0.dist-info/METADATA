# Tymeventure
A small adventure game I'm working on. Currently it's nothing big, but it will be. Eventually.

## How to install
You will need:
 - Python 3.4
 - A functioning computer (literally anything modern will work)

Download the .zip of the game. In the future you really should go to the Releases tab, but there's not much here right now so you can go ahead and just download the latest commit.

Exctract it into a folder. Enter that folder, then run `python setup.py build`.<br>
After that, run `python setup.py install`. (On Linux/UNIX, you have to run with `sudo`.)<br>
Run `tymeventure` to play the game.

## Command-line Arguments

- `-h, --help`: Show help
- `-n, --name NAME`: Set your name
- `--nocolor`: Don't use colors
- `--nointro`: Skip the intro

## FAQ
### What's with the savegames?
The save automatically loads from the current directory - so wherever you launch Tymeventure from is your save directory.
To remove a save, delete the file labeled `YOURNAME_tymeventuresave`.
I reccomend making a save directory called `TymeventureSaves` and `cd`ing into that when you play.

### Where's the Wiki?
You can find the Tymeventure Wikia [here](https://tymeventure.wikia.com).
Currently there is no dev wiki - just the Wikia for gameplay.

### I have an old version installed. Do I need to uninstall it to update?
Nope! Just go through the installation instructions again and it'll automatically update.

### Uh, there's a problem!
Simply report an issue and I'll get to it.

### There was a problem but I fixed it now!
Make a pull request and I'll check it over. If it's good (as in it doesn't introduce more bugs or go against the goal of the project), then I'll add it in.

### I have an idea!
Suggest ideas on [the Scratch topic](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/185267/).<br>
Alternatively, you can make a pull request and add your idea to IDEAS.md.

### Wait... if this is curses-based, why does it work on Windows?
It uses a module called [https://github.com/Chiel92/unicurses](Unicurses), which works like curses, except it can also be used cross-platform on Windows. Go check it out, if you're looking to make a curses based game, I highly recommend it.

## How can I help?
Check the issues to see what needs to be done.
You can also check the Tymeventure Wikia (see above) to document the game.
If you make a change that could be useful, make a pull request.
