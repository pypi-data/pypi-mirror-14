Description: SPORCO is a Python package for solving optimisation problems with
        sparsity-inducing regularisation. These consist primarily of sparse
        coding and dictionary learning problems, including convolutional
        sparse coding and dictionary learning, but there is also support for
        other problems such as Total Variation regularisation and Robust
        PCA. In the current version all of the optimisation algorithms are
        based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The primary requirements are Python itself (SPORCO has only been
        tested on version 2.7), and modules scipy, numpy, pyfftw, and
        matplotlib. Module numexpr is not required, but some functions will be
        faster if it is installed.
        
        Installation of these requirements is system dependent. Under a recent
        version of Ubuntu Linux, the following commands should be sufficient:
        
        ::
        
           sudo apt-get install python-numpy
           sudo apt-get install python-scipy
           sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
           sudo apt-get install python-pip
           sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
           sudo pip install pyfftw
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
           python setup.py build
           python setup.py install
        
        The install command will usually have to be performed with root permissions.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Scripts illustrating usage of the package can be found in the
        ``examples`` directory. These examples can be run from the root
        directory of the package by, for example
        
        ::
        
           python examples/demo_bpdn.py
        
        
        To run these scripts prior to installing the package it will be
        necessary to first set the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to
        include the root directory of the package. For example, in a ``bash``
        shell
        
        ::
        
           export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`
        
        
        from the root directory of the package.
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        If the source has been obtained from a source distribution package
        then HTML documentation can be built in the ``build/sphinx/html``
        directory (the top-level document is ``index.html``) by the command
        
        ::
        
           python setup.py build_sphinx
        
        
        If the source has been cloned from the project github, it is necessary
        to first issue the command
        
        ::
        
           sphinx-apidoc --separate -d 2 -o source ../sporco modules.rst
        
        within the ``docs`` directory.
