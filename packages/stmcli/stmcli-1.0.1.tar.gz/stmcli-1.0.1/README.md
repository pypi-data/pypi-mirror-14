# stmcli
The unofficial STM CLI client.

stmcli aims to use the data made available by the [Société de transport de Montréal](http://www.stm.info/)
to create an easy to use command line application to access bus/metro informations.

## Installation

``` pip install stmcli ```

## Usage

```
usage: stmcli.py [-h] [-b BUS_NUMBER] [-s BUS_STOP_CODE] [-n NUMBER_DEPARTURE]
                 [-d DATE] [-t TIME]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BUS_NUMBER, --bus-number BUS_NUMBER
                        the # of the bus
  -s BUS_STOP_CODE, --bus-stop-code BUS_STOP_CODE
                        the code of the bus stop
  -n NUMBER_DEPARTURE, --number-departure NUMBER_DEPARTURE
                        The number of departures to print. Only works with
                        both -b and -s specified
  -d DATE, --date DATE  specify the date to use when getting Departure times.
                        Format: aaaammjj
  -t TIME, --time TIME  specify the time to use when getting Departure times.
                        Format: HH:MM
```

To get the next departures times you need to specify at least -b and -s which are the bus number and the bus stop code.

For example: ``` stmcli -b 150 -s 52150 ```

would print the next 10 departures times of the bus "150 René-Lévesque EST" at the "du Sussex / René-Lévesque (52150)" bus stop.

If you don't know your bus stop code or your bus number you can specify only -b or -s. specifying only -b will print all of the bus stop and -s alone will print all bus number for this stop code.

By using the -d and/or the -t arguments you can get bus departures times from sometime in the future.

For example: ``` stmcli -b 150 -s 52150 -d 20160328 -t 06:30 ```

Would print almost the same thing as our first example The only exception is that it will print the 10 next departures after 6:30 AM on march 28th 2016.
