What is OpenPNM?
----------------

OpenPNM is an open-source framework for performing pore network modeling
simulations of multiphase transport in porous materials.  It includes
modules for generating various common network topologies, pore and
throat geometry models, pore scale physics models, and fluid property
estimation.  It also contains a growing set of algorithms for running various
simulations such drainage curves, gas diffusion, permeability, and more.

OpenPNM is written in Python making extensive use of Scipy. Python is a very
flexible object oriented programming language that will be familiar to those
with experience using Matlab.  OpenPNM takes advantages of the OOP paradigm
to structure the framework, but uses conventional numerical arrays to store data
and perform calculations.  Our goal is to help other scientists and engineers
harness the power and intuitive pore network modeling approach, so if you are
interested in this package, please contact us through Github, or email one of
the developer directly.
