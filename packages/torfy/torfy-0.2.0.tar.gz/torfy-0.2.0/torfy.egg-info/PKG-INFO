        1 - Description
        ---------------
        
        OSRFramework is a GPLv3+ set of libraries developed by i3visio to perform Open Source Intelligence tasks. They include references to a bunch of different applications related to username checking, information leaks research, deep web search, regular expressions extraction and many others. At the same time, by means of ad-hoc Maltego transforms, OSRFramework provides a way of making these queries graphically.

        3 - Installation
        ----------------
        
        Fast way to do it on any system:
        ```
        pip install torfy
        ```
        Under MacOS or Linux systems, you may need to do this as superuser:
        ```
        sudo pip install torfy
        ```
        This will manage all the dependencies for you.
        
        If you needed further information, check the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.
        
        4 - Basic usage
        ---------------
        
        If everything went correctly (we hope so!), it's time for trying torfy.py. But first, you will need to start the Tor Bundle downloadable from `http://torproject.org`. Execution examples:
        ```
        onionGet.py -u "http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/"
        ```
        
        Type -h or --help to get more information about which are the parameters of the application.
        
        You can also use the functions as a library:
        ```
        import torfy.tor as torwrapper
        url = "http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/"
        data = torwrapper.getResponse(url)
        print data
        ```
        
        5 - HACKING
        -----------
        
        If you want to extend the functionalities of Torfy and you do not know where to start from, check the [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) file.
