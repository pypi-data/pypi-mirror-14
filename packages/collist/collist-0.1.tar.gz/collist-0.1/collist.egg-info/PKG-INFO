Description: collist
        =======
        ``collist`` is a simple module with only one primary function:
        ``collist()``, the single purpose of which is to columnate lists of
        output for priting to the terminal. It is very much like the unix
        command ``column``, but it works on python iterables. This package also
        exports the command ``cols`` which is similar to ``column``, but with
        fewer features and works better (on my system), though it has fewer
        options; see ``cols --help``.
        
        The program uses the ``tput`` command interally, and therefore only
        works with POSIX.
