# Inspiration

The purpose of this project is to ease the troubles of students/TAs/Teachers in Academic Lab Courses by giving them an offline platform to practice/submit/evaluate C codes for algorithm or datastructure problems in an efficient GUI based environment. Their are two parts to this project-- client side and server side. The libraries presently required are:
- Tkinter
- exrex

# Installation

Run the following command line to install the software along with the dependencies:

```shell
$sudo -E apt-get install Lab-Automation==1.0
``` 
# Usage

To run the software use the command line:
```shell
$runlab
```
# For the Instructors

The Instructors need to enter regular expressions which will be used for multiple test case generation. An idea about it can be obtained from the following link:
