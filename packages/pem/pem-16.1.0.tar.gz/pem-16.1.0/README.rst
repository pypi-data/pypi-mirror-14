``pem`` is an MIT_-licensed Python module for parsing and splitting of `PEM files`_, i.e. Base64 encoded DER keys and certificates.

It runs on Python 2.7, 3.4, and PyPy 2.0+, has no dependencies and does not attempt to interpret the certificate data in any way.
``pem`` is intended to ease the handling of PEM files in combination with PyOpenSSL_ and – by extension – Twisted_.

It’s born from the need to load keys, certificates, trust chains, and DH parameters from various certificate deployments: some servers (like Apache_) expect them to be a separate file while others (like nginx_) expect them concatenated to the server certificate.
To be able to cope with both scenarios in Python, ``pem`` was born:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import pem
   >>> certs = pem.parse_file("chain.pem")
   >>> certs
   [<Certificate(PEM string with SHA-1 digest '...')>, <Certificate(PEM string with SHA-1 digest '...')>]
   >>> str(certs[0])
   '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...'

Additionally to the vanilla parsing code, ``pem`` also contains helpers for Twisted that save a lot of boilerplate code.

``pem``\ ’s documentation lives at `Read the Docs <https://pem.readthedocs.org/>`_, the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/hynek/pem>`_.
