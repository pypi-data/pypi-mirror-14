# fish_base

It's my first python package, and mostly for test. Not suggest for download.

Thanks!

functions list:

def get_md5(s)

def serialize_instance(obj)

def auto_add_file_ext(short_filename, ext)

def check_kind_path_file(kind_name, file_name)


I will add more notes and optimized the code in the future.
