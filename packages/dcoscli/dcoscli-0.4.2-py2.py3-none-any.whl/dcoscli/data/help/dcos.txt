System (DCOS)

'dcos help' lists all available subcommands. See 'dcos <command> --help'
to read about a specific subcommand.

Usage:
    dcos [options] [<command>] [<args>...]

Options:
    --help                      Show this screen
    --version                   Show version
    --log-level=<log-level>     If set then print supplementary messages to
                                stderr at or above this level. The severity
                                levels in the order of severity are: debug,
                                info, warning, error, and critical. E.g.
                                Setting the option to warning will print
                                warning, error and critical messages to stderr.
                                Note: that this does not affect the output sent
                                to stdout by the command.
    --debug                     If set then enable further debug messages which
                                are sent to stdout.

Environment Variables:
    DCOS_LOG_LEVEL              If set then it specifies that message should be
                                printed to stderr at or above this level. See
                                the --log-level option for details.

    DCOS_CONFIG                 This environment variable points to the
                                location of the DCOS configuration file.
                                [default: ~/.dcos/dcos.toml]

                                are sent to stdout.

    DCOS_SSL_VERIFY             If set, specifies whether to verify SSL certs
                                for HTTPS, or the path to the certificate(s).
                                Can also be configured by setting
                                `core.ssl_config` in the config.
