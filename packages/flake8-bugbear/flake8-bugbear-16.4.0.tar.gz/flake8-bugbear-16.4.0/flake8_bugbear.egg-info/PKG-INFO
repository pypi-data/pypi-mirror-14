            bug·bear  (bŭg′bâr′)
            n.
            1. A cause of fear, anxiety, or irritation: *Overcrowding is often
               a bugbear for train commuters.*
            2. A difficult or persistent problem: *"One of the major bugbears of
               traditional AI is the difficulty of programming computers to
               recognize that different but similar objects are instances of the
               same type of thing" (Jack Copeland).*
            3. A fearsome imaginary creature, especially one evoked to frighten
               children.

        B001
        ~~~~
        
        Do not use bare ``except:``, it also catches unexpected events " "like
        memory errors, interrupts, system exit, and so on.  Prefer ``except
        Exception:``.  If you're sure what you're doing, be explicit and write
        ``except BaseException:``.
