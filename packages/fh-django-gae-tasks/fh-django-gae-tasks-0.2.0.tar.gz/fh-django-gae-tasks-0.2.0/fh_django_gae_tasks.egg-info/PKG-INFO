Description: AppEngine Deferred module improved
        ==================================
        
        This is forked from FreshPlanet's improved `App Engine Deferred module <https://github.com/freshplanet/AppEngine-Deferred>`_.
        and has the added functionality of having a Django View along with the webapp2 handler so that it can be used in
        either project type.
        
        The AppEngine Python SDK has a great module when it comes to easily run some code "later": `the deferred library <https://developers.google.com/appengine/articles/deferred>`_
        (if you are unfamiliar with this library, please have a look at its documentation first).
        
        However the library has a few drawbacks that we solve here:
        
        - No asynchronous method (`issue 9530 <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=9530>`_)
        - The internal request handler inherits from webapp instead of webapp2 which can be an issue when using some webapp2 features (like webapp2.get_request)
        - It uses pickle instead of leveraging cPickle available with the Python 2.7 runtime.
        - The Route it uses is internal and will skip your middlewares unless you define them in a special appengine_config.py module.
        - Task could fail to properly execute when hitting a fresh instance which did not had all code loaded
        - Logging is a bit verbose: it uses the INFO level to show task headers that are redundant with what we can see by default in the AppEngine logs
        
        We also added a couple of features to it:
        
        - Explicit URLs for tasks: instead of just seeing */_ah/queue/deferred* in your logs you will see something like */_cb/deferred/app.module.name/funcName*
        - Possibility to spread tasks over several queues in case of high throughput
        - Improved logging in case of error
        - Possibility to tie it to a *background* module to optimize serving requests
        
        And some helpers:
        - is_from_task_queue(): Check if we are currently running from a task queue
        - get_retry_count(): Returns the current number of times the current task is being retried
        - log_as_retried(): Depending on # of times the task is being retried, we will increase the logging level.
        
        Our module still makes use of the deferred exceptions types ```SingularTaskFailure``` and ```PermanentTaskFailure``` to be compatible with existing code.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. pip install fh-django-gae-tasks
        2. Load the app in your Django project's settings.py
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                'gae_tasks'
            )
        
        3. Load the URL for the app
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            urlpatterns = [
                url(r'^', include('gae_tasks.urls')),
            ]
        
        4. Optionally, better integrate with your application by updating the tasks settings:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            GAE_TASKS_DISABLE: False
            GAE_TASKS_WARMUP_MODULE: None
            GAE_TASKS_DEFAULT_QUEUES: ['default']
            GAE_TASKS_BACKGROUND_MODULE: None
        
        (See the tasks module for more details)
