pypjlink is a python library and command line utility to interoperate with
projectors through pjlink protocol (http://pjlink.jbmia.or.jp/english/)

It is a fork of the work of Peter Ward (https://bitbucket.org/flowblok/pjlink).


Installation
============

Latest release can be found on pypi and installed with:
$ pip install


Command line usage
==================

Querying projector status is simple:
$ pjlink -p 10.1.1.1 power

and so it is sending commands:
$ pjlink -p 10.1.1.1 power off

A password will be requested if configured on the projector.

Please see help or manpage for complete usage options.


Python library usage
====================

The library supports the following python versions:
* python2.7
* python3.4
* python3.5

>>> from pypjlink import Projector
>>> projector = Projector.from_address('10.1.1.1')
>>> projector.get_power()
'off'
>>> projector.set_power('off')


To run tests, you can use tox to run against every supported python versions
$ tox

Or you can launch tests in current environment:

$ python -m unittest discover pypjlink.tests
