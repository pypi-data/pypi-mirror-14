        .. note::
        
            This module can be imported in python with the name ``django_backend``. The
            PyPI package is called `django-admin-backend`_ though. We had to use a
            different name as ``django-backend`` was already registered on PyPI. It's a
            little unfortunate this way, but a necessary workaround for now.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Add the following apps to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django.contrib.auth',
                'django.contrib.sites',
                'django.contrib.staticfiles',
                ...
                'django_backend',
                'floppyforms',
            )
        
        Make sure ``SITE_ID`` is set:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            SITE_ID = 1
        
        Make sure ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` is valid:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'
        
        **Warning:** Django's default language code is *not* valid, as "en-us" is not included in settings.LANGUAGES.
        
        Add the following line to your ``urls.py``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            url(r'^backend/', include(django_backend.site.get_urls(), namespace='django_backend')),
        
        TODO: continue, propably not complete yet
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Run tests
        ---------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # Set everything up. You want to do this in a virtualenv.
            pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
            python setup.py develop
        
            # Run the tests. Should be executed in the root of the project.
            py.test

        Build static assets
        -------------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            npm install
            gulp build
        
            # Use gulp watch to continuously build on source file changes.
            gulp watch
        
        Or to create a development build that includes source maps, execute the ``dev`` task first, like:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            gulp dev build
        
        
        0.4.2
        -----
        
        - Validate selected elements in ``GenericRelationListField`` against the
          allowed content types. That makes sure no unwanted objects end up in the
          list.
        - Allow name of generic foreign key field to be set explicitly in
          ``GenericRelationListField``. You can use the ``generic_fk_name`` argument
          for this.
        - Adding or changing a new item in a ``GenericRelationListField`` will also
          update the edit link based on the update url in the JSON response.
        - JavaScript: The PageContext got the capability to watch the element that
          represents the page context in the DOM. That allows us to close obsolete
          tooltips even if their original trigger got already removed from the page.
        - JavaScript: The pagecontext element gets the data-pagecontext attribute to
          make it queryable.
        - JavaScript: Bootstrap tooltips are now attached to pagecontext elements
          instead of the body. That will better capsulate them into the pagecontext.
        
        0.4.1
        -----
        
        - Make ``GenericRelationListField`` determine the names of the ``object_id``
          and ``content_type`` fields by inspecting the used ``GenericForeignKey``.
          That will raise errors about wrong usage earlier.
        
        - Fix JS for ``GenericRelationListField`` if used nested multiple levels deep.
          A click handler was called in every instance in the modal stack, so the
          behaviour was different depending on the number of modals.
        
        0.4.0
        -----
        
        - Fix ``GenericRelationListField``. It's internal API was not used correctly
          and therfore just threw errors.
        
        - Allow ``SelectRelatedField`` to pick up inline backends, searching from
          currently active backend. That makes it easier to use customized nested
          inline backends.
        
        0.3.0
        -----
        
        * Adjusted multiple imports:
        
          - Forms, formfields and widgets should be now always imported from
            ``django_backend.forms``. Example::
        
            # OLD import, will no longer work
            from django_backend.backend.base.formfields import SelectRelatedField
        
            # NEW import
            from django_backend.forms import SelectRelatedField
        
        * Add ``ManageRelatedField`` that can inline a list page of a related model
          in the change view.
        
        * Add ``GenericRelationListField`` that can show a reorderable list related
          by a intermediary model with a generic foreign key.
        
        * Use Django's app config to make autoloading of backends predictable.
        
        * Ensuring support for Django 1.6 and 1.8.
        
        * Integrating bootstrap styles for floppyforms widgets.
        
        * Disable caching for backend views.
        
        * Allow subclasses of ``FilterForm`` to define ``filter_queryset_{field_name}``
          methods for easy extendability.
        
        0.1.0
        -----
        
        * Initial release.
