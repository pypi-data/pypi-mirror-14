Description: Cerebrum
        ========
        
        Cerebrum's purpose is getting continuous data inputs from different types of perceptions as
        memory sequences that triggered according to predefined threshold values and creating a complex time
        based relations between those memories by Crossmodal logic  and training multiple Long Short-Term
        Memory Networks with this extracted data. Lastly creating outputs triggered by a stimuli, using
        pre-trained Artificial Neural Networks.
