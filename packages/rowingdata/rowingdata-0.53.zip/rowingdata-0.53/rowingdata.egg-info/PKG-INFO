        Rowingdata
        **************
        
        Based on python code by Greg Smith (https://quantifiedrowing.wordpress.com/) 
        and inspired by the RowPro Dan Burpee spreadsheet (http://www.sub7irc.com/RP_Split_Template.zip)

        ==================
        To Use 
        ==================
        
        Beta. Use with caution. 
        
        Import
        ---------
        
        Import the package
        
        >>> from rowingdata import *
        
        Your personal data
        -----------------------
        
        If you're not me (or have identical heart rate thresholds), 
        you will have to change the default values for the rower. For example:
        
        >>> john = rowingdata.rower(hrut2=100,hrut1=120,hrat=140,hrtr=150,hran=170,hrmax=180,c2username="johntherower",c2password="caughtacrab")
        
        You can store this locally like this
        
        >>> john.write("johnsdata.txt")
        
        Then you can load this like this
        
        >>> john = rowingdata.read_obj("johnsdata.txt")
        
        Painsled
        ----------------
        
        To use with Painsled CSV data, simply do
        
        >>> row = rowingdata.rowingdata("testdata.csv",rower=myrower)
        >>> row.plotmeters_erg()
        >>> print row.allstats()
        
        To use with RowPro CSV data, simply do
        
        >>> rp = rowingdata.RowProParser("RP_testdata.csv")
        >>> rp.write_csv("example_data.csv")
        >>> row = rowingdata.rowingdata("example_data.csv")
        >>> row.plotmeters_erg()
        >>> row.plottime_erg()
        >>> print row.summary()
        
        CrewNerd (and other TCX)
        ---------------------------
        
        To use with CrewNerd TCX data, simply do
        
        >>> tcx = rowingdata.TCXParser("2016-03-25-0758.tcx")
        >>> tcx.write_csv("example_data.csv")
        >>> row = rowingdata.rowingdata("example_data.csv",rower=myrower)
        >>> row.plotmeters_otw()
        >>> row.plottime_otw()
        >>> print row.summary()
        
        Other useful stuff
        ----------------------------
        
        To get any data column as a numpy array, use (for example for HR data - 
        see list below for other accessible data fields).
        
        >>> row.getvalues[' HRCur (bpm)']
        
        To create the colorful plots as well as copy a text summary to the clipboard,
        assuming you have a summary file from CrewNerd called 2016-03-25-0758.CSV and 
        a TCX file called 2016-03-25-0758.TCX
        
        >>> rowingdata.dorowall("2016-03-25-0758")
        
        Now you will have the summary data on your clipboard
        
        >>> row.uploadtoc2()
        
        This will upload your row to Concept2 logbook. It just simply fill the online 
        form for you. So nothing more than total distance and duration, date, weight 
        category and row type
        
        ==============
        Data Fields

        * 'cum_dist'
        
        ======================
        Known bugs
        ======================
        
        * Something wrong with the time values when imported from RowPro 
        
        =======================
        Future functionality
        =======================
        
        
        * Add some command line tools to do the most common stuff
        
        * Add support for other erg software tools (just need the csv/tcx and it will be easy)
