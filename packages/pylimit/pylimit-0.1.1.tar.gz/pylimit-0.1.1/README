# pylimit
Rate limiting library for python using Redis

# Prerequisites
This library makes use of Redis and needs it as a prerequisite. Redis sentinel is also supported.
Make sure that Redis server is running before using this library

# Example
For this example, let's assume that redis hostname is 'localhost' and port number is 6379
Suppose you want to limit the number of api calls to be 1000 per minute. It can be done by the following steps.

1.) Import the library
```
from pylimit import PyLimit
```

2.) Initialize the library
```
PyLimit.init(redis_host="localhost", redis_port=6379)
```

3.) Create a rate limit namespace
```
limit = PyLimit()
limit.create('api_count',           # namespace
             60,                    # rate limit period in seconds
             100)                   # no of attempts in the time period
```

4.) Record ant attempt and check if it is allowed or not
```
is_allowed = limit.attempt('api_count')   # will return true if number of attempts
                                          # are less than or equal to 1000 in last 1 minute,
                                          # false otherwise
```
