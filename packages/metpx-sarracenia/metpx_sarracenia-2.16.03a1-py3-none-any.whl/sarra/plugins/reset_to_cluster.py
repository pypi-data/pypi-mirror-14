"""
   Overwrite to_cluster definition for products that are posted.
   This can be useful or necessary when re-distributing beyond the original intended
   destinations.
   
  for example company A delivers to their own DMZ server.  ACME is a client of them,
  and so subscribes to the ADMZ server, but the to_cluster=ADMZ, when ACME downloads, they
  need to override the destination to specify the distribution within ACME.
