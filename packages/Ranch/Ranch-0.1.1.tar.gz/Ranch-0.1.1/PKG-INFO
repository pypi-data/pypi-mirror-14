            *Ranch is a dressing… get it?*
        
        In which addressing is easy
        ---------------------------
        
        Doing addressing is hard. There's too many
        `exceptions <https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/>`__,
        `differences <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_(geography)#Mailing_address_format_by_country>`__
        and `human
        involvement <http://grcdi.blogspot.nl/2011/01/myth-of-deliverability.html>`__;
        making the entire process overwhelmingly
        `depressing <https://www.instagram.com/sadtopographies/>`__.
        
        In which addressing has never been done before
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        Luckily, we're not the first people to have faced this problem.
        `Plenty <https://github.com/commerceguys/addressing>`__
        `of <https://github.com/googlei18n/libaddressinput>`__
        `people <https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal>`__ have attempted to
        tackle the problem of addressing, and plenty have succeeded! So no,
        Ranch isn't reinventing the wheel entirely. Instead, we're working with
        Google's excellent i18n dataset: downloading it, parsing it, outputting
        data.
        
        In which I have to do everything myself
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Ranch is built as an object to store your address data in. So instead of
        having you access a bunch of stuff and doing checks yourself, Ranch
        allows you to enter address field data and poll for whatever the next
        set of fields is to fill in.
        
        After that you can simply call a ``str(address)`` to correctly format
        the address for the address' locality. That's all you need to get a
        (technically) deliverable postal address from your users.
        
        In which all that made sense
        ----------------------------
        
        See ``try_me.py`` for an example: a commandline-based address form.
