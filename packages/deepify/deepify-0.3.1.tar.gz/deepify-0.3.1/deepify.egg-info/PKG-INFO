        ---------------
        
        Deepify is a GPLv3+ set of libraries developed by i3visio to perform Open Source Intelligence tasks in some part of the internet that are not as easy to access as the conventional part of the web.

        3 - Installation
        ----------------
        
        Fast way to do it on any system:
        ```
        pip install deepify
        ```
        Under MacOS or Linux systems, you may need to do this as superuser:
        ```
        sudo pip install deepify
        ```
        This will manage all the dependencies for you.
        
        If you needed further information, check the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.
        
        4 - Basic usage
        ---------------
        
        If everything went correctly (we hope so!), it's time for trying deepify. But first, you will need to start the Tor Bundle downloadable from `http://torproject.org`. Execution examples:
        ```
        # Check that you have the Tor Browser running and that the options in ~/.config/Deepify folder are correct
        onionGet.py -u "http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/"
        # Check that you have the Zeronet running and that the options in ~/.config/Deepify folder are correct
        zeronetGet.py -u "1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D"
        ```
        
        Type -h or --help to get more information about which are the parameters of the application.
        
        You can use the functions as a library for collecting information from Tor:
        ```
        # Check that you have the Tor Browser running and that the options in ~/.config/Deepify folder are correct
        import deepify.tor as tor
        url = "http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/"
        data = tor.getResponse(url)
        print data
        ```
        You can also check it in Zeronet:
        ```
        # Check that you have the Zeronet service running and that the options in ~/.config/Deepify folder are correct
        import deepify.zeronet as zeronet
        url = "1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D"
        data = zeronet.getResponse(url)
        print data
        ```
        
        5 - HACKING
        -----------
        
        If you want to extend the functionalities of Deepify and you do not know where to start from, check the [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) file.
