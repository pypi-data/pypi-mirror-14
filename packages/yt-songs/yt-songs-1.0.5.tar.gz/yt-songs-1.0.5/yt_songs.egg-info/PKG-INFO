        YT Songs searches, downloads and normalizes the titles of a list of songs from youtube using youtube-dl.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install with pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pip install -U yt-songs
        
        Usage
        -------
        
        Create a songs file like test_songs_ and run:
        
        .. _test_songs: https://github.com/MinikOlsen/yt-songs/blob/master/test_songs
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                yt-songs get SONGS_FILE DST_FOLDER
        
        Options:
        
        - **-v** or **--verbose** to print the full youtube-dl output.
        - **-s** or **--skip** to skip the normalization.
        - **-n** NUMBER or **--number** NUMBER to download a search result other than the first.
        - **-c** FILE or **--config** FILE to use a different  config file. It may be useful to have multiple config files for different needs.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Since yt-songs runs on top of youtube-dl, any `youtube-dl option`_ can be used for yt-songs, with exception of *logger* and *progress_hooks*, which are set internally.
        
        The following command opens the YAML config file in the user's preferred editor:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                yt-songs config -e
        
        .. _`youtube-dl option`: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py#L121-L269
        
        The options for yt-songs are:
        
        name_template
            A `name template`_ for youtube-dl's output. This option overwrites its youtube-dl analogue outtmpl in ydl_opts.
        
            .. _`name template`: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl#output-template
        
        temp_folder
          A temporary folder to store the files before normalizing the titles.
        
        replacements
          The replacements to perform with regular expressions in order to normalize the titles.
        
        ydl_opts
          Youtube-dl options.
