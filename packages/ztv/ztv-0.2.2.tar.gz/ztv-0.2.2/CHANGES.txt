ztv Change Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------------------
0.2.2   2016-03-08
------------------

- cleaned up release of current codebase incorporating lots of bugfixes from recent months.

----------------------
0.2.2dev2   2015-12-27
----------------------

- fixed bug in overview image panel where non-square images weren't being displayed correctly

----------------------
0.2.2dev1   2015-12-27
----------------------

- first steps toward refactoring out cursor code relating to specific control panels from main ztv code

--------------------
0.2.1-9   2015-11-25
--------------------

- pypandoc hadn't been installed when released -8, so had to re-do

--------------------
0.2.1-8   2015-11-25
--------------------

- updated fits_faker_panel to work with wxpython v3
- fixed bug in ztv_api that was causing crashes when using control_panel_module_path keyword (used by fits_faker_panel example)

--------------------
0.2.1-7   2015-11-03
--------------------

- emergency bug fix

--------------------
0.2.1-6   2015-11-03
--------------------

- Made default datadir and auto-load pattern be the current working directory (rather than just user's home dir)
- dev2:  made temporary fix to ztv.set_clim to force image redisplay even when cim unchanged.  Problem was that new images weren't being displayed automatically for a fixed clim.  (Need to come back and re-evaluate how images are loaded and look for remaining inefficiencies, e.g. code called more than once during a single image load)
- dev3:  speed improvements in areas that will help speed of auto-loading new images; primarily reducing number of extraneous recalculations of aperture photometry
- dev4:  speed improvements in areas that will help speed of auto-loading new images; primarily reducing number of times that redraw_*_image routines are called
- dev5:  reduce number of times that image normalization is recalculated by caching; modified some syntaxes for easier future upkeep.  
- dev6:  moved rebinning of overview image (really sub-sampling, not rebinning) from allowing matplotlib to do implicitly to doing explicitly before passing to matplotlib.  This speeds things up a lot (0.3sec on a ~2014 MacBook Pro Retina) for large (2K) images.

--------------------
0.2.1-5   2015-09-22
--------------------

- added a delay to WatchMasterPIDThread before beginning watch loop

--------------------
0.2.1-3   2015-09-08
--------------------

- updated README.md for anaconda install example

--------------------
0.2.1-2   2015-09-08
--------------------

- added instructions for install on a fresh OS X Yosemite 10.10 system using Homebrew Python distribution to README.md
- added instructions for install on a fresh OS X Yosemite 10.10 system using Anaconda Python distribution to README.md
- in ztv_api.py: for launching ztv in a separate python process, made `pythonw` the default python executable, reverting to `python` only if `pythonw` is not available.  This gets around some of the Frameworks/wxPython issues that crop up when running in a virtual environment, particularly, e.g., anaconda python distro.

------------------
0.2.1-1
------------------

- fixed __init__.py so that "import ztv ; print ztv.__version__" works

------------------
v0.2.1, 0.2.0
------------------

- now requiring wxPython version >= 3.0.0  (This is the reason for the larger bump in version number)
- fixed a number of GUI bugs that wxPython upgrade introduced. (More likely than bugs with wxPython 3 is that the wxPython 2 had bugs that had been worked-around and/or other issues.)
- added instructions for install on a fresh OS X Yosemite 10.10 system using system's Python distribution to README.md
- (No difference between v0.2.0 and v0.2.1 in git repository, except that had messed up uploading to pypi & couldn't rewrite the same filename, so had to increment version number to fix formatting of README.md on pypi webpage.  Issue was pypandoc install was broken first time I built.)

------------------
v0.1.3dev
------------------

2015-07-29:
- implemented that z-key on primary image activates a plot in z-dim of image stack in plot_panel 
- FITS header is updated in fits header window when a new file is loaded (or header for sky file or header for flat file)
- misc bug fixes

pre-2015-07-29:
- updated version number b/c realized had already released 0.1.2
- fixed bug in plot_panel where doing slice beyond image size caused warnings.
- implemented click-and-drag to aperture radii on profile plot in phot_panel

------------------
v0.1.2, 2015-04-22
------------------

- updated version number b/c had already released 0.1.1dev
