        CHANGES
        *******
        
        0.3 (2016-03-30)
        ================
        
        - Document ``importscan`` package that can be used in combination with
          this one.
        
        - Introduced ``factory_arguments`` feature on ``config`` factories,
          which can be used to create dependency relationships between
          configuration.
        
        - Fix a bug where config items were not always properly reused. Now
          only the first one in the action class dependency order is used, and
          it is not recreated.
        
        0.2 (2016-03-29)
        ================
        
        - Remove clear_autocommit as it was useless during testing anyway.
          In tests just use explicit commit.
        
        - Add a ``dectate.sphinxext`` module that can be plugged into Sphinx
          so that directives are documented properly.
        
        - Document how Dectate deals with double imports.
        
        0.1 (2016-03-29)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release.
