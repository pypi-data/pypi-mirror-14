CHANGES
*******

0.5 (2016-04-04)
================

- **Breaking change** The signature of ``commit`` has changed. Just
  pass in one or more arguments you want to commit instead of a list. See
  #8.

0.4 (2016-04-01)
================

- Expose ``code_info`` attribute for action. The ``path`` in
  particular can be useful in implementing a directive such as
  Morepath's ``template_directory``. Expose it for composite too.

- Report a few more errors; you cannot use ``config``, ``before`` or
  ``after`` after in an action class if ``group_class`` is set.

- Raise a DirectiveReportError if a DirectiveError is raised in a
  composite ``actions`` method.

0.3 (2016-03-30)
================

- Document ``importscan`` package that can be used in combination with
  this one.

- Introduced ``factory_arguments`` feature on ``config`` factories,
  which can be used to create dependency relationships between
  configuration.

- Fix a bug where config items were not always properly reused. Now
  only the first one in the action class dependency order is used, and
  it is not recreated.

0.2 (2016-03-29)
================

- Remove clear_autocommit as it was useless during testing anyway.
  In tests just use explicit commit.

- Add a ``dectate.sphinxext`` module that can be plugged into Sphinx
  so that directives are documented properly.

- Document how Dectate deals with double imports.

0.1 (2016-03-29)
================

- Initial public release.
