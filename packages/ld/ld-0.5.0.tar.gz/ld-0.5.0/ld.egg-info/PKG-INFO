Description: Linux Distribution - a Linux OS platform information API
        ========================================================
        
        The `ld` (for: Linux Distribution) package provides information about the
        Linux distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or
        version information.
        
        It is a renewed alternative implementation for Python's
        original `platform.linux_distribution` function, but it also provides much more
        functionality.
        An alternative implementation became necessary because Python 3.5 deprecated
        this function, and Python 3.7 is expected to remove it altogether.
        Its predecessor function `platform.dist` was already deprecated since
        Python 2.6 and is also expected to be removed in Python 3.7.
        Still, there are many cases in which access to that information is needed.
        See [Python issue 1322](https://bugs.python.org/issue1322) for more
        information.
        
        The `ld` package implements a robust and inclusive way of retrieving the
        information about a Linux distribution based on new standards and old methods,
        namely from these data sources (from high to low precedence):
        
        * The os-release file `/etc/os-release`, if present.
        * The output of the `lsb_release` command, if available.
        * The distro release file (`/etc/*(-|_)(release|version)`), if present.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```shell
        pip install ld
        ```
        
        For dev:
        
        ```shell
        pip install https://github.com/nir0s/ld/archive/master.tar.gz
        ```
        
        ## Python and Distribution Support
        
        The `ld` package is supported on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5, and on
        any Linux distribution that provides one or more of the data sources
        used by this package.
        
        This package is currently tested on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.5, with test
        data that mimics the exact behavior of the data sources of the following
        Linux distributions:
        
        * Arch Linux
        * CentOS 5/7
        * Debian 8
        * Exherbo
        * Fedora 19/23
        * KVM for IBM z Systems 1
        * Mageia 5
        * openSUSE Leap 42
        * Oracle Linux Server 7
        * RHEL 6/7
        * Slackware 14
        * SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12
        * Ubuntu 14
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        python
        >>> import ld
        >>> ld.linux_distribution(full_distribution_name=False)
        '('centos', '7.1.1503', 'Core')'
        ```
        
        Several more functions are available. For a complete description of the
        API, see the [latest API documentation](http://ld.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
