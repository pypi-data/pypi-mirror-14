    Infrastructure as code at Dimension Data with Apache Libcloud

    :param fileName: the location of the plan for the fittings
    :type fileName: ``str``

    Plumbery is a convenient tool for infrastructure managers at cloud times.
    It allows for easy and repeatable deployments of various
    fittings, including compute nodes and related storage. It allows also for
    quick dismandling of the fittings when required.
    The idea here is not to compete with respected solutions such as chef or
    puppet. At its name implies, plumbery is targeting pipes and fittings, the
    very basic utility stuff that sophisticated tools can leverage.

    Example::

        from plumbery.engine import PlumberyEngine
        engine = PlumberyEngine('fittings.yaml')
        engine.build_all_blueprints()

    In this example the overall plan, in textual format, is given to the engine
    in preparation of subsequent processing. The software is not trying to
    guess a name by default, so if you do not provide a name, no configuration
    file is loaded. You can load the plan at any stage, or restart the engine
    with an updated plan, by invoking the member function ``parse_layout()``

    Note:
        While plumbery is not making assumptions for your configuration files,
        if your infrastructure is simple enough to fit in one single file then
        you are highly encouraged to name it ``fittings.yaml``

    Beyond the plan for your fittings, plumbery is also requiring some specific
    credentials to connect to cloud providers. To preserve the confidentiality
    of such information, it is read from the environment, and not from any
    configuration file. Therefore the need for local setup before running
    plumbery. This is part of the installation process.

    Last but not least, plumbery sets the root password of any new server that
    it creates. For obvious security reasons this is not taken from the
    fittings plan but from the environment, or it can be set in code.

    Under Linux, you may want to edit ``~/.bash_profile`` like this::

        # credentials to access cloud resources from Dimension Data
        export MCP_USERNAME='foo.bar'
        export MCP_PASSWORD='WhatsUpDoc'

        # password to access nodes remotely
        export SHARED_SECRET='*you really want to put a tricky password here*'

    These simple precautions are aiming to protect your infrastructure as much
    as possible. The general goal is to minimize risks induced by exposure to
    your fittings plan. You may lead transformation towards so-called
    infrastructure as code, and for this you will add version control to your
    fittings plan. As a result, plans will be stored in git or equivalent, and
    shared across some people.

        Random secrets can be used in scripts and in configuration files
        sent to nodes, for example to configure a database server.

        For this you would put ``{{ random.secret }}`` in your files and let
        plumbery provide a value for you.

        The `id` parameter designates one secret among several.

        This function builds a random string out of ASCII letters, digits, and
        a couple of punctuation letters.
        The string has 9 characters by default.

        If you put `.uuid` in the id, than the function ``uuid.uuid4()`` is
        called to generate a unique identifier of 36 letters.

        The `format` parameter specifies the kind of string that is expected:
        * 'user' - to be read by a human being
        * 'sha1' - rather long string too
        * 'md5' - rather long string
        * 'sha256' - longest and most secure

        Some examples:

            {{ server1.uuid }}
            {{ server2.uuid }}
            {{ sql_root.secret }}
            {{ redis.master.md5.secret }}
            {{ redis.slave.secret }}
            {{ database357.sha1.secret }}

        In a nutshell, this function is giving you a lot of flexibility
