        Description
        ====================
        
        Firecloud API bindings and FISS Command-Line interface. 
        
        This package was formerly known as "fissfc", but has evolved
        to provide more sophisticated abstractions for interacting
        with firecloud in addition to the command line tool.
        
        ====================
        Requirements
        ====================
        
        Firecloud uses the Google Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) to manage
        authorization. To use the firecloud CLI or API, you must install the SDK and 
        login locally with
        
            gcloud auth login

        Release Notes
        ====================
        v0.7.2 - Fix some commands that broke with the API changes
        
        v0.7.1 - Add workspace functions for importing entities and creating entity sets.
        
        v0.7.0 - Renamed package "firecloud", replacing "fissfc" 
                    - firecloud_cli.py renamed fiss.py
                    - firecloud_api.py renamed api.py
                 Added workspace class for more flexible python interactivity. Example:
                   >>> w = Workspace.new("broad-firecloud-testing", "my_workspace")
                   >>> w.bucket()
                   "fc-92e4ic0a-60fb-454a-8ue0-d0efea803421"
                   >>> w.lock()
                 Added better error messaging for unexpected FireCloud Errors
        
        v0.6.2 - Add '--protected' option for workspace creation.
        
        v0.6.1 - Firecloud production API is now https://api.firecloud.org/api
        
        v0.6.0 - Refactored the argument structure for inferring a default project. 
                 Instead of passing the namespace as an optional input to a 
                 subcommand, the project can be overriden explicitly with the -p 
                 top-level flag. This cleans up the syntax for many commands, and 
                 makes the help clearer. 
        
                 Add --all option to space_list
                 attr_get:
                     * attributes now given a a list of positional arguments, 
                          instead of comma-separated
                     * entity type limited to firecloud supported entities
                 Fixed help messages for many commands
        
        
        v0.5.0 - Add python 3 support, so that fissfc should be installable to 
                 either version. A TLS issue may still prevent fissfc from 
                 working on some versions of python.
        
        v0.4.1 - Add attr_get subcommand, as a replacement for fiss annot_get.
                 Clarify error message. 
        
        v0.4.0 - Implement default value for google project into most subcommands
        
        v0.3.2 - Add check in firecloud_api for  the existence of gcloud credentials
        
        v0.3.1 - Add confirmation prompt for delete commands, and a 
                 Flag to override them.
        
        v0.3.0 - Added support for Yapsy plugins. 
        
        v0.0.1 - Initial Release
