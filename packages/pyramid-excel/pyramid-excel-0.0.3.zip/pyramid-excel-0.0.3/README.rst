**pyramid-excel** is based on `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_ and makes
it easy to consume/produce information stored in excel files over HTTP protocol as
well as on file system. This library can turn the excel data into a list of lists,
a list of records(dictionaries), dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence it
lets you focus on data in Pyramid based web development, instead of file formats.

The idea originated from the problem of the illiteracy of excel file formats of
non-technical office workers: such as office assistant, human resource administrator.
There is nothing with the un-deniable fact that some people do not know the
difference among various excel formats. It becomes usability problem to those
people when a web service cannot parse the excel file that they saved using
Microsoft Excel. Instead of training those people about file formats, this library
helps web developers to handle most of the excel file formats by unifying the
programming interface to most of the excel readers and writers.

The highlighted features are:

#. excel data import into and export from databases
#. turn uploaded excel file directly into Python data struture
#. pass Python data structures as an excel file download
#. provide data persistence as an excel file in server side
#. supports csv, tsv, csvz, tsvz by default and other formats are supported via
   the following plugins:

.. _file-format-list:

.. table:: A list of file formats supported by external plugins

This library makes infomation processing involving various excel files as easy as
processing array, dictionary when processing file upload/download, data import into
and export from SQL databases, information analysis and persistence. It uses
**pyexcel** and its plugins:

#. to provide one uniform programming interface to handle csv, tsv, xls, xlsx, xlsm and ods formats.
#. to provide one-stop utility to import the data in uploaded file into a database and to export tables in a database as excel files for file download.
#. to provide the same interface for information persistence at server side: saving a uploaded excel file to and loading a saved excel file from file system.

Installation
================================================================================
You can install it via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyramid-excel


or clone it and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone http://github.com/pyexcel/pyramid-excel.git
    $ cd pyramid-excel
    $ python setup.py install

Setup
======
Once the pyramid_excel is installed, you must use the config.include mechanism to include
it into your Pyramid project's configuration::

    config = Configurator(.....)
    config.include('pyramid_excel')

Alternately, you may activate the extension by changing your application's .ini file by
adding it to the pyramid.includes list::

    pyramid.includes = pyramid_excel
