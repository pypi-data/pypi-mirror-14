    Parses MPG Ranch Song Meter audio files.
    
    This class provides information about an MPG Ranch Song Meter audio
    file. Some of the information, including the station name and the
    recording start time, is obtained by parsing the audio file name.
    The information obtained from the file name may optionally be
    transformed according to information provided in the preferences
    file:
    
        MPG Ranch/Song Meter Audio File Parser.yaml
        
    located within the user's preferences directory. For example, a
    station name alias that appears in a file name can be mapped to
    the "official" archive station name, and channel microphone names
    can be determined from a table that specifies the microphones
    used at various stations during various date ranges.
    
    The rest of the information, including the length of the recording
    in sample frames and the recording sample rate, is obtained from
    within the audio file.
