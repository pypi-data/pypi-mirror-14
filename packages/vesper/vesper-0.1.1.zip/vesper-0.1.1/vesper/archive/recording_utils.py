    Merges a collection of recordings.
    
    This method first sorts a collection of recordings by station name
    and start time. It then merges longest subsequences of consecutive
    recordings into single recordings.
    
    Two recordings are deemed consecutive if:
    
        1. They have the same station name.
        
        2. They have the same sample rate.
    
        3. The end time of the first recording as computed from its start
           time, length, and sample rate is not farther than `tolerance`
           seconds from the start time of the second recording.
           
    Each output recording contains the input recordings that were merged
    to create it in its `subrecordings` attribute.
