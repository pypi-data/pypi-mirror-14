    # transformations should cover the vast majority of cases.

    # It may be advantageous to maintain the date/time portion of
    # calibrations separately from the seconds portions. For example,
    # a calibration might comprise a start offset in seconds (zero by
    # default), a frame rate in frames per second (one by default),
    # and a start date/time (none by default). Then most or all of
    # the transformations that we might need could operate only on
    # the offset and frame rate. This would help maintain precision
    # since date/time data structures are often not as precise as
    # times in double precision seconds. Python's datetime class,
    # for example, keeps time only to the nearest microsecond.

    # learning curves suggested that the classifier that included the
    # norm might be superior if trained on a larger number of examples.
    # The learning curve for features that did not include the norm rose
    # more quickly than the learning curve for features that did include
    # the norm, but also leveled off more, so that it looked like the
