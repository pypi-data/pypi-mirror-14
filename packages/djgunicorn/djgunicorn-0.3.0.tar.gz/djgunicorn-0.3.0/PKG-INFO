Description: =============================
        django-gunicorn
        =============================
        
        Run Django development server with Gunicorn.
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Install django-gunicorn::
        
            pip install djgunicorn
        
        Then add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``. You will get a new command
        ``gunserver`` (please forgive my little pun-loving self). It runs like
        Django's development server, but the HTTP handling is backed by Gunicorn.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        You can find available options with::
        
            python manage.py help gunserver
        
        Most options work as the built-in ``runserver`` command (in
        ``django.contrib.staticfiles``). Exceptions:
        
        * The ``verbosity`` and ``no-color`` settings are *not* passed to Gunicorn.
          They still affect messages emitted by the command itself, however.
        * The ``nothreading`` option does not do anything.
        
        
        Todo
        ----
        
        * Unit tests and CI.
        * Check how low we can support Django and Gunicorn versions.
        * Support for additional Gunicorn configs that may be useful. SSL seems to
          be a common need.
        * Is it possible to conditionally replace the ``runserver`` command? By
          installing an alternative app config, for example?
        * We now use ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` to relay where the settings module is
          to the Gunicorn subprocess (and let Django loads it automatically). This
          causes problems if ``settings.configure()`` is called manually without a
          module, and will likely require some hacks to fix.

        History
        -------
        
        0.3.0 (2016-04-13)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Add Gunicorn config changing directory to where ``manage.py`` to avoid
          problems when ``manage.py`` is run in another directory.
        * Info message is now displayed when Gunicorn reloads, as ``runserver`` does.
        * Enable extended ``runserver`` provided by ``staticfiles`` only if it is
          installed (which is the default).
        * Gunicorn access logs are now coloured, as ``runserver``'s.
        * Get rid of a custom static handler in favour of Django's stock one.
        
        
        0.2.0 (2016-04-12)
        ++++++++++++++++++
