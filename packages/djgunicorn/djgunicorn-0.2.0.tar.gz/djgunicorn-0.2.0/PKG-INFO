Description: =============================
        django-gunicorn
        =============================
        
        Run Django development server with Gunicorn.
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Install django-gunicorn::
        
            pip install djgunicorn
        
        Then add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``. You will get a new command
        ``gunserver`` (please forgive my little pun-loving self). It runs like
        Django's development server, but the HTTP handling is backed by Gunicorn.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        You can find available options with::
        
            python manage.py help gunserver
        
        Most options work as the built-in ``runserver`` command (in
        ``django.contrib.staticfiles``). Exceptions:
        
        * The ``verbosity`` and ``no-color`` settings are *not* passed to Gunicorn.
          They still affect messages emitted by the command itself, however.
        * The ``nothreading`` option does not do anything.
        
        
        Todo
        ----
        
        * Unit tests and CI.
        * Check how low we can support Django and Gunicorn versions.
        * Support for additional Gunicorn configs that may be useful. SSL seems to
          be a common need.
        * Is it possible to conditionally replace the ``runserver`` command? By
          installing an alternative app config, for example?
        * Output redirection. Currently we always use stderr, but we should respect
          ``Command.stdout`` and ``Command.stderr``.
        * The startup message is not printed when reloading. It is possible to hook
          this with Gunicorn server hooks (through a config file), but the problem
          is how we can pass the correct information into it.
