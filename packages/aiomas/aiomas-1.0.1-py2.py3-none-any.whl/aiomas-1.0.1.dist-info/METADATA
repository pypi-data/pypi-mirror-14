aiomas – A library for multi-agent systems and RPC based on asyncio
===================================================================

*aiomas* is an easy-to-use library for *request-reply channels*, *remote
procedure calls (RPC)* and *multi-agent systems (MAS)*.  It’s written in pure
Python on top of asyncio__.

Here are three simple examples that show the different layers of aiomas and
what they add on top of each other:

The *request-reply channel* has the lowest level of abstraction (but already
offers more then vanilla asyncio):

.. code-block:: python3

   >>> import aiomas
   >>>
   >>>
   >>> async def handle_client(channel):
   ...     """Handle a client connection."""
   ...     req = await channel.recv()
   ...     print(req.content)
   ...     await req.reply('cya')
   ...     await channel.close()
   >>>
   >>>
   >>> async def client():
   ...     """Client coroutine: Send a greeting to the server and wait for a
   ...     reply."""
   ...     channel = await aiomas.channel.open_connection(('localhost', 5555))
   ...     rep = await channel.send('ohai')
   ...     print(rep)
   ...     await channel.close()
   >>>
   >>>
   >>> server = aiomas.run(aiomas.channel.start_server(('localhost', 5555), handle_client))
   >>> aiomas.run(client())
   ohai
   cya
   >>> server.close()
   >>> aiomas.run(server.wait_closed())

The *RPC layer* adds remote procedure calls on top of it:

.. code-block:: python3

   >>> import aiomas
   >>>
   >>>
   >>> class MathServer:
   ...     router = aiomas.rpc.Service()
   ...
   ...     @router.expose
   ...     def add(self, a, b):
   ...         return a + b
   ...
   >>>
   >>> async def client():
   ...     """Client coroutine: Call the server's "add()" method."""
   ...     rpc_con = await aiomas.rpc.open_connection(('localhost', 5555))
   ...     rep = await rpc_con.remote.add(3, 4)
   ...     print('What’s 3 + 4?', rep)
   ...     await rpc_con.close()
   >>>
   >>> server = aiomas.run(aiomas.rpc.start_server(('localhost', 5555), MathServer()))
   >>> aiomas.run(client())
   What’s 3 + 4? 7
   >>> server.close()
   >>> aiomas.run(server.wait_closed())

Finally, the *agent layer* hides some of the boilerplate code required to setup
the sockets and allows agent instances to easily talk with each other:

.. code-block:: python3

   >>> import aiomas
   >>>
   >>> class TestAgent(aiomas.Agent):
   ...     def __init__(self, container):
   ...         super().__init__(container)
   ...         print('Ohai, I am %s' % self)
   ...
   ...     async def run(self, addr):
   ...         remote_agent = await self.container.connect(addr)
   ...         ret = await remote_agent.service(42)
   ...         print('%s got %s from %s' % (self, ret, remote_agent))
   ...
   ...     @aiomas.expose
   ...     def service(self, value):
   ...         return value
   >>>
   >>> c = aiomas.Container.create(('localhost', 5555))
   >>> agents = [TestAgent(c) for i in range(2)]
   Ohai, I am TestAgent('tcp://localhost:5555/0')
   Ohai, I am TestAgent('tcp://localhost:5555/1')
   >>> aiomas.run(until=agents[0].run(agents[1].addr))
   TestAgent('tcp://localhost:5555/0') got 42 from TestAgentProxy('tcp://localhost:5555/1')
   >>> c.shutdown()

*aiomas* is released under the MIT license. It requires Python 3.4 and above
and runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows.

Installation
------------

*aiomas* requires Python >= 3.4.  It uses the *JSON* codec by default and only
has pure Python dependencies.

Install *aiomas* via pip__ by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install aiomas

You can enable the optional MsgPack__ codec or its Blosc__ compressed version
by installing the corresponding features (note, that you need a C compiler to
install them):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install aiomas[mp]   # Enables the MsgPack codec
   $ pip install aiomas[mpb]  # Enables the MsgPack and MsgPackBlosc codecs

__ https://pip.pypa.io/
__ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msgpack-python/
__ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blosc/


Features
--------

*aiomas* just puts three layers of abstraction around raw TCP / unix domain
sockets provided by *asyncio*:

Agents and agent containers:
  The top-layer provides a simple base class for your own agents. All agents
  live in a container.

  Containers take care of creating agent instances and performing the
  communication between them.

  The container provides a *clock* for the agents. This clock can either be
  synchronized with the real (wall-clock) time or be set by an external process
  (e.g., other simulators).

RPC:
  The *rpc* layer implements remote procedure calls which let you call methods
  on remote objects nearly as if they were normal objects:

  Instead of ``ret = obj.meth(arg)`` you write ``ret = await obj.meth(arg)``.

Request-reply channel:
  The *channel* layer is the basis for the *rpc* layer. It sends JSON__ or
  MsgPack__ encoded byte strings over TCP or unix domain sockets. It also maps
  replies (of success or failure) to their corresponding request.

Other features:

- TLS support for authorization and encrypted communication.

- Interchangeable and extensible codecs: JSON and MsgPack (the latter
  optionally compressed with Blosc) are built-in.  You can add custom codecs or
  write (de)serializers for your own objects to extend a codec.

- Deterministic, emulated sockets: A *LocalQueue* transport lets you send and
  receive message in a deterministic and reproducible order within a single
  process.  This helps testing and debugging distributed algorithms.

Some ideas for future releases:

- Optional automatic re-connect after connection loss

Changelog
=========

1.0.1 – 2016-04-22
------------------

- [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed the ``async`` argument for ``Container.created()``
  and ``Container.shutdown()`` to ``as_coro``.  Realized to late that it will
  come to name clashes with the ``async`` keyword added to Python 3.5.
  I assume that no one really uses this project yet, thus I mark it as bug-fix
  relaese rather then bumping aiomas to v2.


1.0.0 – 2016-04-18
------------------

- [BREAKING CHANGE] ``Channel.close()`` and ``RpcClient.close()`` are now
  coroutines.

- [BREAKING CHANGE] ``rpc.start_server()`` and ``rpc.open_connection()`` now
  take RPC services instead of routers.  Services are the objects that contain
  the routers.  To fix your code, replace things like
  ``router=MyService().router`` with ``rpc_service=MyService()``.

- [CHANGE] ``Channel.send()`` now raises a ``ValueError`` if a message is too
  long to be send.  A message is too long if its length does not fit into
  a 32bit unsigned integer.

- [NEW] The various *connect* functions now accept a *timeout* parameter.  If
  it is set to a number > 0 (or to ``None``) it tries to connect for the
  specified amount of time (or indefinitely) before raise
  a ``ConnectionRefusedError``.  This way, you can start clients before (or at
  the "same" time) you start the server.

- [NEW] You can register a callback to ``RpcClient`` that gets called when the
  network connection is reset.  This helps reacting to connection losses if the
  ``RpcClient`` only has an RPC service running but is not actively performing
  any task.

- [NEW] Added a ``aiomas.SerializationError`` that gets raised if a message
  cannot be serialized.

- [NEW] Added a ``subproc`` module that helps you to spawn subprocesses for
  agents.  Each subprocess will have a container and a managing agent that can
  be remote-controlled to start more agents within its container.

- [NEW] Added a ``LocalQueue`` transport that sends messages of multiple
  connections (e.g., from different agent containers) within a process in
  a deterministic order.  This should make debugging, tuning and testing
  easier.

- [NEW] A lot of documentation.


0.6.1 – 2015-10-21
------------------

- [CHANGE] Agent now also accepts subclasses of Container (`issue #17`_).

- [FIX] `issue #16`_: Container API docs no correctly refer to the "create()"
  method.

.. _`issue #16`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/16/
.. _`issue #17`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/17/


0.6.0 – 2015-09-18
------------------

- [CHANGE] Asserted Python 3.5 compatibility and converted all examples to use
  the new ``async`` and ``await`` keywords.

- [CHANGE] ``Container.__init__()`` no longer contains an asynchronous task.
  Instead, you now need to call the factory function ``Container.create()``.

- [CHANGE] Removed ``Container.spawn()``.  You can now directly instantiate
  agent instances but you still need to pass a reference to the agent's
  container to ``Agent.__init__()``.

- [NEW] ``AiomasError`` is the new base class for all errors in aiomas (`issue
  #15`_).

- [NEW] Documentation tests now have their own *tox* environment (``tox -e
  docs``).

- [NEW] Added support and docs_ for TLS encryption.

- [NEW] Added some documentation about the channel layer.

.. _docs: https://aiomas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tls.html
.. _`issue #15`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/15/


0.5.0 – 2015-06-27
------------------

- [CHANGE] Agent addresses now start with *tcp://* or *ipc://* (for Unix domain
  sockets) instead of just *agent://*.

- [CHANGE] Using dictionaries as routers is now easier (`issue #13`_).

- [CHANGE] Renamed the ``rpc`` attribute for routers to ``router``.

- [CHANGE] Renamed ``Agent.name`` to ``Agent.addr`` and improved agent's *str*
  representation.

- [CHANGE] Updated and improved *str* and *repr* for agents, proxies and agent
  proxies.

- [CHANGE] ``Codec.add_serializer()`` now raises an exception if there is
  already a serializer for a given type (`issue #9`_).

- [NEW] Added ``aiomas.util.run()`` (and an ``aiomas.run()`` alias) which are
  shortcuts for ``loop = asyncio.get_event_loop();
  loop_run_{until_complete|forever}()``.

- [NEW] Added a ``@serializable`` decorator to ``aiomas.codecs`` which
  simplifies making a type serializable.

- [NEW] Documentation: Overview, Agents, Codecs, Clocks (draft), Testing (draft).

- [NEW] ``Container.connect()`` checks if an agent exists in the remote
  container.

- [NEW] Proxies are now cached with weakrefs.

- [FIX] `issue #12`_: ``Router.path`` reversed the order of path components.

- [FIX] Fixed a bug where concurrent calls to ``Container.connect()`` would
  lead to multiple connections to the same address.

.. _`issue #9`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/9/
.. _`issue #12`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/12/
.. _`issue #13`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/13/


0.4.0 – 2015-04-15
------------------

- [CHANGE] ``Channel`` and ``Container`` no longer take codec instances but
  classes.  They also accept a list of factories for extra serializers.

- [CHANGE] The ``rpc.open_connection()`` and ``rpc.start_server()`` methods
  no longer accept the ``add_to`` parameter.  ``rpc.start_server()`` accept
  a *client_connected_cb* instead, which should be a function with one
  argument, the ``RpcClient`` for each new connection.
  ``rpc.open_connection()`` already returns the ``RpcClient()``.

- [CHANGE] Renamed the package extras from *MsgPack* to *mp* and from
  *MsgPackBlosc* to *mpb* to work around a bug in pip/setuptools.  They are
  also shorter now. ;-)

- [NEW] ``RpcClient`` no has a ``channel`` and a ``service`` attribute.

- [NEW] Improved error message for ``LookupError``.

- [FIX] `issue #8`_:  Every channel instance created by
  ``channel.start_server()`` now has a separate codec instance to avoid
  problems with some serializers.

.. _`issue #8`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/8/


0.3.0 – 2015-03-11
------------------

- [CHANGE] Removed LocalProxies and everything related to it because they
  caused several problems.  That means that agents within a single container
  now also communicate via TCP sockets.  Maybe something similar but more
  robust will be reintroduced in a later release.

- [CHANGE] ``Channel.send()`` is no longer a coroutine.  It returns a Future
  instead.

- [CHANGE] Removed ``Container.get_url_for()`` which didn’t (and couldn’t) work
  as I originally assumed.

- [CHANGE] ``JSON`` is now the default codec.  msgpack and blosc don’t get
  installed by default.  This way, we only have pure Python dependencies for
  the default installation which is very handy if you are on Windows.  You can
  enable the other codecs via ``pip install -U aiomas[MsgPack]`` or ``pip
  install -U aiomas[MsgPackBlosc]``.

- [NEW] Support for Python 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 (yes, Python 3.3 with asyncio works,
  too, but I’ll drop support for it as soon as it becomes a burden) (Resolves
  `issue #6`_).

- [NEW] ``ExternalClock`` accepts a date string or an Arrow object to set the
  inital date and time.

- [NEW] ``aiomas.util.async()`` which is like ``asyncio.async()`` but registers
  a callback that instantly captures and raises exceptions, instead of delaying
  them until the task gets garbage collected.

- [NEW] The agent container adds a serializer for Arrow dates.

- [NEW] ``Proxy`` implements ``__eq__()`` and ``__hash__()``.  Two different
  proxy objects sharing the same channel and pointing to the same remote
  function will no appear to be equal.  This makes it less error prone to use
  Proxy instances as keys in dictionaries.

- [NEW] Updated and improved flow-control for ``Channel`` and its protocol.

- [NEW] Improved error handling if the future returned by ``Channel.send()``
  is triggered or cancelled by an external party (e.g., by going out of scope).
  If asyncio’s DEBUG mode is enabled, you will even get more detailed error
  messages.

- [NEW] ``MessagePackBlosc`` codec.  It uses msgpack to serialize messages and
  blosc to compress them.  It can massively reduce the message size and
  consumes very little CPU time.

- [NEW] A Contract Net example
  (https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/src/tip/examples/contractnet.py)

- [NEW] ``__str__()`` representations for agents, containers and codecs (fixes
  `issue #5`_).

- [FIX] `issue #7`_: Improved error handling and messages if the
  (de)serialization raises an exception.

- [FIX] Containers now work with unix domain sockets.

- [FIX] Various minor bug-fixes

.. _`issue #5`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/5/
.. _`issue #6`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/6/
.. _`issue #7`: https://bitbucket.org/sscherfke/aiomas/issue/7/


0.2.0 - 2015-01-23
------------------

- [CHANGE] The *MsgPack* codec is now the default.  Thus, *msgpack-python* is
  now a mandatory dependency.

- [CHANGE] Renamed ``RpcClient.call`` to ``RpcClient.remote``.

- [NEW] ``aiomas.agent`` module with an ``Agent`` base class and
  a ``Container`` for agents.  Agents within a container communicate via direct
  method calls.  Agents in different containers use RPC.

- [NEW] ``aiomas.clock`` module which offers various clocks for a MAS:

  - ``AsyncioClock`` is a real-time clock and wraps asyncio's ``time()``,
    ``sleep()``, ``call_later()`` and ``call_at()`` functions.

  - ``ExternalClock`` can be synchronized with external simulation
    environments.  This allows you to *stop* the time or let it pass
    faster/slower than the wall-clock time.

- [NEW] Support for unix domain sockets in ``aiomas.channel`` and
  ``aiomas.rpc``.

- [NEW] "rpc_service()" tasks created by an RPC server can now be collected
  so that you can wait for their completion before you shutdown your program.

- [NEW] Added contents to the README and created a Sphinx project.  Only the
  API reference is done yet.  A tutorial and topical guides will follow.

- [FIX] aiomas with the JSON codec is now compatible to simpy.io



0.1.0 – 2014-12-18
------------------

Initial release with the following features:

- A *request-reply channel* via TCP that allows to send multiple messages and
  to asynconously wait for results (or an exception).

- Messages can be serialized with *JSON* or *msgpack*.

- The underlying communication protocol should be compatible with `simpy.io
  <https://bitbucket.org/simpy/simpy.io/>`_ (if you use JSON and no custom
  serializers).

- Remote procedure calls (RPCs) supporting nested handlers and bidirectional
  calls (callees can make calls to the caller before returning the actual
  result).
