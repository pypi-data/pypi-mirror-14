========


A plugin for `gg <https://github.com/peterbe/gg>`_ for starting new branches.


Installation
============

This is a plugin that depends on ``g`` which gets automatically
installed if it's not already available::

    pip install gg-start

How to develop
==============

To work on this, first run::

    pip install -U --editable .

That installs the package ``gg`` and its dependencies. It also
installs the executable ``gg``. So now you should be able to run::

    gg start --help
