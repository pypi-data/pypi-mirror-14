        gg-start
        ========
        
        
        A plugin for `gg <https://github.com/peterbe/gg>`_ for starting new branches.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        This is a plugin that depends on ``g`` which gets automatically
        installed if it's not already available::
        
            pip install gg-start
        
        How to develop
        ==============
        
        To work on this, first run::
        
            pip install -U --editable .
        
        That installs the package ``gg`` and its dependencies. It also
        installs the executable ``gg``. So now you should be able to run::
        
            gg start --help
