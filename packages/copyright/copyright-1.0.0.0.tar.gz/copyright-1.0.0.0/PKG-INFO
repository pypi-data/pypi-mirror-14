Description: Overview
        --------
        
        Add or replace license/copyright boilerplate in source code files.
        
        All contiguous comment blocks (bounded by empty or code lines) that
        contain a copyright message are stripped before injecting the new
        message.
        
        You should commit all your code into a repo before running this program
        and check the results with a diff utility.

        --------
        
        -  Autodetect language from extension or shebang or header.
        -  Force programming language to use if files cannot be autodetected.

        ::
        
            $ copyright -c config.json
        
        Process files matching wildcards, appending to end of file.
        
        ::
        
            $ copyright -a 'Joe Smith' -p MyApp -l mit -i '*.py,foo*.h,script?' --back
        
        Use custom template.
        
        ::
        
            $ copyright -c config.json -t my_templates.json --license my-license-2.0

        FAQ
        ---
        
        Q1. How can you keep multiple licenses in a file? A1. One strategy is to
        create a custom templates file that has all the licenses merged into one
        key/value pair, and then process your specific list of files.
