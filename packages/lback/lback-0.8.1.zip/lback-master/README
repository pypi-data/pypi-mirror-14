OpenSuse Linux Backup
==========================================================================================

This document outlines the usage of 
"OpenSuse Linux Backup" in remote and local
settings. There is 'not' a man page and merely
a help command that can be used in conjuction
with this README. Below you will also find
ways to optimize for backups and restores

======================================================================================================

Regular Backups (Local)

to run a local backup you can use:

lback --client --local --backup --folder "/folder/"

this will instruct the program to backup the folder/" locally
and when done send a success message telling you it is complete.

Regular Restores (Local)

to restore a folder having backed it up, you need
to have its id. Which can be found in the database or
whenever a transaction is complete. For example:

lback --client --local --restore --id "b6bbd382-337b-4bcf-a1b5-017f8c8d7a9c"

this will fully restore this archive back to its initial
state. Should it result in any error, it will throw a warning
telling you what went wrong.

REMOTE backups:

To start a server. You may use:

lback --server

OR equivalently:

lback-server

"this will start the program in server mode and listen to any
connections"

IMPORTANT: For the client, a running server 'must' be set up for remote backups.
You can set this in "settings.json". "server_ip" and "server_port"
the client will attempt to communicate on this tcip channel.
The commands for a restore and backup are analagous to local. For example:

lback --client --remote --backup --folder "/folder/"

lback --client --remote --restore --id "b6bbd382-337b-4bcf-a1b5-017f8c8d7a9c"

When done successfully, 
database transactions kept should be similar on both the client and server.

More on servers:

This program makes no optimizations for server vs client. And both
machines can run as either. The implementor must decide which to
use as a server, client. Moreover settings.json 'should' be identical
on both machines.

Whenever a client successfully transfers data to the server. The data 'will'
not be available immediately. Full propagation can take time depending
on the folder's size.

Benchmark results:

108 megabytes (transfering XUL SDK)
took ~ 3 minutes to archive and delivery
another 3


Generating a list of backups:

To fetch all backups to date, you can use:

lback --list


Profiler (experimental):

The profiler as described in the initial document, is a way to
run timely backups. In this directory you will find "profiles.json"
it has one profile with a unix timestamp. The timestamp is
when the backup will be ran. Profiler is a daemon and can be run
with the following command 

lback --profiler
