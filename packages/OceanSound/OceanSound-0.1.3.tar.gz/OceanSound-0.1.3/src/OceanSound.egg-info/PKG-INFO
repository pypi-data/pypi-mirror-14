        ==========
        
        Get the music from oceancolor images, through MODIS satellite
        
        Instalation
        -----------
        OceanSound requires an **pyhdf** instalation, to deal with HDF4 [(HDF-EOS)](http://hdfeos.org/).
        Despite **pyhdf** is a deprecated package it still works, but you have to manualy install it.  
        Follow the steps [here](http://pysclint.sourceforge.net/pyhdf/install.html)!
        
        And finally to listen your data you can install OceanSound with pip.
        
        ```bash
        pip install OceanSound
        ```
        
        Usage
        -----
        After installation, OceanSound program is enabled on your terminal.
        You should pass one of acceptable parameters and generate your music.
        
        ```bash
        OceanSound --indir dir/where/are/*.hdf --outdir dir/to/save/output.midi
        ```

        OceanSound deals with Satellite MODIS chlorophyll, but if you are interested by extracting music from your data take a 
        look at [DataSounds](http://www.datasounds.org) and access the [code](https://github.com/DataSounds/DataSounds)!
