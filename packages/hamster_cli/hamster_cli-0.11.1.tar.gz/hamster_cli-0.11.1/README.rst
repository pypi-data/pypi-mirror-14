A basic CLI for the hamster time tracker.

*WARGING* 
This is still pre-alpha software. Altough we are reaching apoint were most things work
as intended we make no promisse about your data as well as any commitment. In particular there is no
intension to migrate any databases from this version to any future more mature release.

News (2016-04-16)
-----------------
Version 0.11.0 has been release. This is a major step forward as our previous release was rushed and
turned out to be not too usable at all. This release Privides a solid and robust way to handle user
configs as well as providing a default config setup.
We further increased our test coverage and are well above 90% by now. Including some basic integration
tests.
For more details, see the changelog.

Have fun tinkering, Eric.
