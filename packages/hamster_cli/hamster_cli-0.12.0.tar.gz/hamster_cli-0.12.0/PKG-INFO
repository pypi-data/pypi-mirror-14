        *WARNING*
        This is still pre-alpha software. Altough we are reaching apoint were most
        things work as intended we make no promisse about your data as well as any
        commitment. In particular there is no intension to migrate any databases from
        this version to any future more mature release.
        
        News (2016-04-25)
        -----------------
        Version 0.12.0 is out! With this version we feel confident that you may be able
        to actually play with ``hamster-cli`` in a somewhat productive way. Whilst we
        are still far from being production ready and miss a significant amount of
        legacy feature this release may give you quite the idea where we are heading.
        For the first time we were able to give the frontend some love whilst further
        beefin up our QA toolchain, introducing even more tests and new test
        environments. The documentation has been vastly improved, digging into the code
        never was easier.
        
        Happy hacking; Eric.

        History
        -------
        
        0.12.0 (2016-04-25)
        -------------------
        * ``stop`` now shows detail on the fact saved.
        * ``current`` now shows how much time was accumulated so far.
        * Remove standalone script block. You are expected to utilize pip/setuptools to
          setup ``hamster_cli``. ``virtualenvs`` FTW!
        * Testenvironment now uses linkchecks and ``doc8`` for validating the
          documentation.
        * Removed 'GTK window' related pseudo methods. Until the functionality is
          actually here.
        * Added ``manifest`` validation to testenvironment.
        * Added ``pep257`` validation to testsuite.
        * Vastly improved docstring, docstringcoverage and frontend helptexts.
        * Use ``hamsterlib 0.10.0`` new improved config layout.
        * Add GPL boilerplate and frontend information.
        * ``release`` make target now uses ``twine``.
        * Provide new ``details`` command to list basic runtime environment details.
        
        0.11.0 (2016-04-16)
        --------------------
        * New, solid config handling.
