A basic CLI for the hamster time tracker.

News (2016-04-16)
-----------------
Version 0.11.0 has been release. This is a major step forward as our previous release was rushed and
turned out to be not too usable at all. This release Privides a solid and robust way to handle user
configs as well as providing a default config setup.
We further increased our test coverage and are well above 90% by now. Including some basic integration
tests.
For more details, see the changelog.

Have fun tinkering, Eric.
