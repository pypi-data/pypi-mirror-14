        django-zappa - Serverless Django
        ================================
        
        |Django-CC| |Build Status| |Coverage| |Slack|
        
        **django-zappa** makes it super easy to deploy Django applications on
        AWS Lambda + API Gateway. Think of it as "serverless" web hosting for
        your Django apps.
        
        That means:
        
        -  **No more** tedious web server configuration!
        -  **No more** paying for 24/7 server uptime!
        -  **No more** worrying about load balancing / scalability!
        -  **No more** worrying about keeping servers online!
        -  **No more** worrying about security vulnerabilities and patches!
        
        **django-zappa** handles:
        
        -  Packaging projects into Lambda-ready zip files and uploading them to
           S3
        -  Correctly setting up IAM roles and permissions
        -  Automatically configuring API Gateway routes, methods and integration
           responses
        -  Turning API Gateway requests into valid WSGI, and returning API
           Gateway compatible HTTP responses
        -  Deploying your application to various stages of readiness (dev,
           staging, prod)
        
        **Awesome!**
        
        `See it in action here! <https://zappa.gun.io/>`__ You can also watch a
        **`screencast on how to use
        django-zappa <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plUrbPN0xc8&feature=youtu.be>`__**.
        
        This project is for Django-specific integration. If you are interested
        in how this works under the hood, you should look at the **`Zappa core
        library <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa>`__**, which can be used by
        any WSGI-compatible web framework.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        *Before you begin, make sure you have a valid AWS account and your `AWS
        credentials
        file <https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs>`__
        is properly installed.*
        
        **django-zappa** can easily be installed through pip, like so:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install django-zappa
        
        In your Django settings, you will need to add ``django_zappa`` to your
        installed apps in order to add Zappa commands to your management script.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'django_zappa',
            ]
        
        Finally, define a ZAPPA\_SETTINGS setting in your local settings file
        which maps your named deployment environments to deployed settings and
        an S3 bucket (which must already be created). These can be named
        anything you like, but you may wish to have seperate *dev*, *staging*
        and *production* environments in order to separate your data.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            ZAPPA_SETTINGS = {
                'production': {
                   's3_bucket': 'production-bucket',
                   'settings_file': '~/Projects/MyApp/settings/production_settings.py',
                },
                'staging': {
                   's3_bucket': 'staging-bucket',
                   'settings_file': '~/Projects/MyApp/settings/staging_settings.py',
                },
            }
        
        Notice that each environment defines a path to a settings file. This
        file will be used as your *server-side* settings file. Specifically, you
        will want to define `a new
        SECRET\_KEY <https://gist.github.com/Miserlou/a9cbe22d06cbabc07f21>`__,
        as well as your deployment DATABASES information. Zappa now supports
        both *MySQL-Python* and *pyscopg2* via
        `lambda-packages <https://github.com/Miserlou/lambda-packages>`__.
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        Initial Deployments
        -------------------
        
        Once your settings are configured, you can package and deploy your
        Django application to an environment called 'production' with a single
        command:
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py deploy production
            Deploying..
            Your application is now live at: https://7k6anj0k99.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production
        
        And now your app is **live!** How cool is that?!
        
        Updates
        -------
        
        If your application has already been deployed and you only need to
        upload new Python code, but not touch the underlying routes, you can
        simply:
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py update production
            Updating..
            Your application is now live at: https://7k6anj0k99.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production
        
        Rollback
        --------
        
        You can also rollback the deployed code to a previous version by
        supplying the number of revisions to return to. For instance, to
        rollback to the version deployed 3 versions ago:
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py rollback production 3
        
        Management
        ----------
        
        If you want to invoke Django management commands on the remote Zappa
        instance, you simply call the 'invoke' management command locally:
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py invoke production check
            System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
        
        Tailing Logs
        ------------
        
        You can watch the logs of a deployment by calling the 'tail' management
        command.
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py tail production
        
        Advanced Usage
        ==============
        
        There are other settings that you can define in your ZAPPA\_SETTINGS to
        change Zappa's behavior. Use these at your own risk!
        
        .. code:: python
        
            ZAPPA_SETTINGS = {
                'dev': {
                    'aws_region': 'us-east-1', # AWS Region (default US East),
                    'domain': 'yourapp.yourdomain.com', # Required if you're using a domain
                    'http_methods': ['GET', 'POST'], # HTTP Methods to route,
                    'integration_response_codes': [200, 301, 404, 500], # Integration response status codes to route
                    'memory_size': 512, # Lambda function memory in MB
                    'method_response_codes': [200, 301, 404, 500], # Method response status codes to route
                    'parameter_depth': 10, # Size of URL depth to route. Defaults to 5.
                    'role_name': "MyLambdaRole", # Lambda execution Role
                    's3_bucket': 'dev-bucket', # Zappa zip bucket,
                    'settings_file': '~/Projects/MyApp/settings/dev_settings.py', # Server side settings file location,
                    'touch': False, # GET the production URL upon initial deployment (default True)
                    'use_precompiled_packages': True, # If possible, use C-extension packages which have been pre-compiled for AWS Lambda
                    'vpc_config': { # Optional VPC configuration for Lambda function
                        'SubnetIds': [ 'subnet-12345678' ], # Note: not all availability zones support Lambda!
                        'SecurityGroupIds': [ 'sg-12345678' ]
                    }
                }
            }
        
        Keeping the server warm
        -----------------------
        
        Lambda has a limitation that functions which aren't called very often
        take longer to start - sometimes up to ten seconds. However, functions
        that are called regularly are cached and start quickly, usually in less
        than 50ms. To ensure that your servers are kept in a cached state, you
        can `manually configure <http://stackoverflow.com/a/27382253>`__ a
        scheduled task for your Zappa function that'll keep the server cached by
        calling it every 5 minutes. There is currently no way to configure this
        through API, so you'll have to set this up manually. When this ability
        is available via API, django-zappa will configure this automatically. It
        would be nice to also add support LetsEncrypt through this same
        mechanism.
        
        Enabling CORS
        -------------
        
        To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for your application,
        follow the `AWS 'How to CORS'
        Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-cors.html>`__
        to enable CORS via the API Gateway Console. Don't forget to re-deploy
        your API after making the changes!
