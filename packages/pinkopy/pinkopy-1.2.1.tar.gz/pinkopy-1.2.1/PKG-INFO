        pinkopy is a Python wrapper for the Commvault api. Of course it does very little initially, but there is no reason to duplicate work across projects.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            git clone git@github.com:theherk/pinkopy.git
            pip install pinkopy
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ```python
        from pinkopy import CommvaultSession
        
        config = {
            'service': 'service url',
            'user': 'username',
            'pw': 'password'
        }
        
        with CommvaultSession(**config) as s:
            client_jobs = s.get_jobs('1234', job_filter="Backup")
            cust_jobs = s.get_subclient_jobs(client_jobs, '12345678', last=3)
            # multi status
            for job in cust_jobs:
                job_id = job['jobSummary']['@jobId']
                job_details = s.get_job_details('1234', job_id)
                job_vmstatus = s.get_job_vmstatus(job_details)
        ```
        
        Contribution
        ------------
        
        Please do contribute to this repository. It currently only supports a small set of the api provided by Commvault. However, if you do contribute, please follow these guidelines.
        
        ### Guidelines
        
        + Use [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/). Your pull requests must come from a Gitflow branch.
            - feature/yourfeature
            - bugfix/issuenumber
        + **ONLY** imperative commit messages. Line one is one imperative, brief sentence. Following lines may have more details.
        + Builds must pass (which should be pretty easy right now, since there are no tests).
        + Never commit binary files.
        + Make sure you are committing with your Github user.

        #### Name
        
        The name was originally going to be commpy, but then I liked commiepy. From here it was only a small leap to pinkopy, a tribute to a dear friend of mine.
