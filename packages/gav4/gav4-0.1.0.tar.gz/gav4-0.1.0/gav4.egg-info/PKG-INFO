Description: # Google Analytics Reporting V4 Compatibility Library
        
        A library for converting Google Analytics Core Reporting API V3 request to Analytics Reporting API V4 requests.
        
        ## Installation
        
            $ pip install --upgrade gav4
        
        
        ## Typical usage example
        
        There are two methods of using the gav4 library. You can `apply` the library to an authorized Google Analytics Service object, which exposes a get method that operates much like the current Core Reporting API V3.
        
            import gav4
        
            # Apply the gav4 get method to the authorized service object.
            gav4.apply_gav4(analytics)
        
            # Call the gav4_get method with a V3 request and get a V3 response.
            v3_response = analytics.gav4_get(v3_request).execute()
        
        Alternatively you can convert the requests and responses directly.
        
            # Convert a V3 request into a V4 request.
            v4_request = gav4.convert_request(v3_request)
        
            # Call the V4 API.
            v4_response = analytics.reports().batchGet(body=v4_request).execute()
        
            # Convert the V4 API response into a V3 response.
            v3_response = gav4.convert_report(v4_response.get('reports', [])[0])
        
        ## Testing
        
        Run the tests with the following command:
        
            python setup.py tests
        
        This may require you to install the nose library -- `pip install nose`.
