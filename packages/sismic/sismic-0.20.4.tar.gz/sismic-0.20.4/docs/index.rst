About
-----

*Sismic* is a recursive acronym that stands for *Sismic Interactive Statechart Model Interpreter and Checker*.

The Sismic library for Python (version 3.4 or higher)
is developed at the `Software Engineering Lab <http://informatique.umons.ac.be/genlog>`_
of the `University of Mons <http://www.umons.ac.be>`_
as part of an ongoing software modeling research project.
Sismic is released publicly under the `GNU Lesser General Public Licence version 3.0 (LGPLv3)
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>`_.

Sismic provides a set of tools to define, validate, simulate, execute and test statecharts.
Statecharts are a well-known visual modeling language for representing the executable behavior
of complex reactive event-based systems.


Features
--------

Sismic provides the following features:

- An easy way to define and to import statecharts, based on the human-friendly YAML markup language
- A statechart interpreter offering a discrete, step-by-step, and fully observable simulation engine
- Synchronous and asynchronous simulation, in real time or simulated time
- Support for communication between statecharts and co-simulation
- Built-in support for expressing actions and guards using regular Python code
- A design-by-contract approach for statecharts: contracts can be specified to express invariants, pre- and postconditions on states and transitions.
- Predefined step definitions and utilities (including test coverage) to support behavior-driven development.
- A unit testing framework for statecharts, including generation of test scenarios

Sismic statecharts provides full support for the majority of the UML 2 statechart concepts:

- simple states, composite states, orthogonal (parallel) states, initial and final states, shallow and deep history states
- state transitions, guarded transitions, automatic (eventless) transitions, internal transitions
- statechart variables and their initialisation
- state entry and exit actions, transition actions
- internal and external events, parametrized events, timed events

The Sismic library is written in a modular way:

- The semantics of the statechart interpreter is based on the specification of the SCXML semantics (with a few exceptions), but can be easily tuned to other semantics.
- Guards, actions and contracts are expressed using a Python evaluator
- Statecharts can invoke Python code defined in their environment
- Statecharts can communicate with one another by sending events
