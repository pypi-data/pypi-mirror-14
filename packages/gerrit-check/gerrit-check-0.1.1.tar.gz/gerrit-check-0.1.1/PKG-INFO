Description: 
        Many projects use Gerrit for code-reviews and in addition use static code
        analysis tools to report about the quality of the code in review. For example,
        Jenkins comes with a nice integration of Gerrit, there is no suitable way to
        generate line-by-line annotations of the output of static code analysis tools
        for Gerrit.
        
        This project allows you to transform the output of the tools: cppcheck,
        cpplint and flake8 into line by line comments in Gerrit.
