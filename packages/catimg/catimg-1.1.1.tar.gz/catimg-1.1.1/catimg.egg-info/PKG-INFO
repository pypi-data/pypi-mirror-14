Description: 
        catimg
        
        Uses iTerm2's proprietary escape codes and Imgur to display an image of a cat
        in your terminal.
        
        NOTE: I do not own the images that you see, nor have I any control over
        them. You will see some image that is tagged as "cat" on Imgur. That could be
        anything. I do filter out images that are tagged NSFW, but there are no
        guarantees that you won't see something you wish you hadn't. Use at your own
        risk.
