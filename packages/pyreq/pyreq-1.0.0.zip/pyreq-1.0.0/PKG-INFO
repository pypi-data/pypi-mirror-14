        ===================================
        
        pyreq is a simple console based http and https client. 
        It allows you to use most HTTP verbs, send arbitrary data along with the request, and save the result to file. 
        It also automaticly pretty-prints JSON, which is very useful for exploring APIs.
        
        
        To install, just run the following command:
        
        ::
        	pip install pyreq
        
        You can get a list of all options and what they mean by running::
