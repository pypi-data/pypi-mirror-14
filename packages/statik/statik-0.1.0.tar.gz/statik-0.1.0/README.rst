Statik
======

Overview
--------

**Statik** aims to be a simple, yet powerful, static web site generator.
It is currently designed with developers in mind, and, unlike most other
static web site generators, is *not* geared towards building blogs by
default.

Before you begin, make sure you know your HTML (especially
`Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__ templates),
`Markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`__ and
`JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`__. If you really want to get
fancy with your site, you can learn some
`SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`__ - specifically the
`SQLite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite>`__ dialect.

Dependencies
------------

You will need the following to be able to install Statik:

-  Some kinds of POSIX-based OS, or Mac OS (Windows support will
   eventually be included, but right now it will break due to the way
   that Statik handles file system paths)
-  Python 2.7.x (Python 3 support will come once Jinja2's Python 3
   support graduates from being experimental)
-  ``virtualenv`` if you want to run the code in a virtual environment
   or want to contribute to the development.

Virtual Environment
-------------------

If you don't want to install this package globally (perhaps you're using
Python 3 globally, but have to use Python 2 to run Statik), do the
following:

.. code:: bash

    > cd /path/to/your/desired/virtualenv
    > virtualenv -p python27 .
    > source bin/activate

The above makes the assumption that your Python 2.7.x interpreter's
executable file is called ``python27`` and is available on the path. The
last line (``source bin/activate``) activates the virtual environment.
Now you're free to run your Python 2.7 in a sandboxed environment,
installing whatever dependencies you want, and they won't interfere with
your global dependencies.

If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, simply just:

.. code:: bash

    > deactivate

Installation
------------

Once you've got your virtual environment working, check out this
repository and run the ``setup.py`` script:

.. code:: bash

    > cd /path/to/where/you/want/it
    > git clone https://github.com/thanethomson/statik.git
    > cd statik/
    > python setup.py install

This should install Statik into your virtual environment, and will
automatically install all of its Python dependencies too. It will also
install a script, ``statik``, whose usage is as follows.

Usage
-----

Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running the Statik script from the command line is easy:

.. code:: bash

    > statik

That assumes that you want to build the project in the current folder.
If you want to build a project in a different folder, simply run:

.. code:: bash

    > statik -p /path/to/your/project/folder
    # or
    > statik --project /path/to/your/project/folder

For help (doesn't give you any more than this right now), run:

.. code:: bash

    > statik --help

From Code
~~~~~~~~~

If you want to embed Statik in your own Python application, simply
import the ``StatikProject`` class and use as follows:

.. code:: python

    from statik import StatikProject

    # tell Statik where to find the project
    project = StatikProject("/path/to/project/to/build")
    # execute the build
    project.build()

For more fine-grained control, see the source, which is relatively
well-documented.

Project Structure
-----------------

By default we refer to a single site's data and generated HTML content
into a *project*, and projects have a very specific structure. Your base
project structure should look similar to the following example.

::

    config.json              - Global configuration for the project

    models/                  - Data models (i.e. classes) are stored here
    models/Post.json         - Structure definition for the "Post" class
    models/Page.json         - Structure definition for the "Page" class
    models/Author.json       - Structure definition for the "Author" class

    data/                    - Data for the various models (i.e. instances) are stored here
    data/Post/               - Instances of the "Post" class
    data/Post/myfirstpost.md - An instance of the "Post" class
    data/Page/               - Instances of the "Page" class
    data/Page/home.md        - Instance of the "Page" class for the home page
    data/Page/about.md       - Instance of the "Page" class for the about page
    data/Author/             - Instances of the "Author" class
    data/Author/michael.md   - Instance of the "Author" class for user "Michael"

    templates/               - Jinja2 templates
    templates/base.html      - Example base HTML template file
    templates/header.html    - Example partial template
    templates/footer.html    - Example partial template

    views/                   - View configuration, connecting your templates, models and data
    views/home.json          - Home page configuration
    views/pages.json         - Configuration for our pages
    views/posts.json         - Configuration for posts
    views/authors.json       - Configuration for authors

    assets/                  - Any files that are to be copied as-is into your destination project's "assets" folder

Global Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global ``config.json`` file contains settings relevant to the
overall functioning of your generated site. The following fields are
standard:

.. code:: js

    {
      // String containing the global, human-readable name of your project.
      "projectName": "My project",

      // A list of strings containing the names of different kinds of execution
      // profiles for your project. This allows you to override certain settings
      // depending on which profile it is you're building for.
      // Default: ["production"]
      "profiles": ["dev", "prod"],

      // The output mode for generating URL paths. Can be one of:
      // "standard" - Generates URLs like /posts/2016/04/02/my-first-post.html
      // "pretty"   - Generates URLs like /posts/2016/04/02/my-first-post/index.html
      // Default: "standard"
      "outputMode": "pretty",

      // The base URL from which your site will eventually be served. This is
      // important, because sometimes web sites can be served from different
      // base paths to the root of the web server (e.g. http://site.com/basepath/
      // instead of http://site.com/). Statik generates URL references in your
      // templates in a relative manner, and this base URL will always be prefixed
      // to all generated URLs in the output.
      "baseUrl": "/",

      // Either a relative or absolute path in which to generate the output
      // HTML content. Default: [project path]/public/
      "outputPath": "./public/",

      // This object allows us to override certain facets of our configuration
      // depending on the selected profile for which we're building the site.
      // The global configuration values that can be overridden are:
      // baseUrl, outputPath
      "profileConfig": {
        // Configuration
        "dev": {
          // Overrides the previous "baseUrl" and "outputPath" settings
          "baseUrl": "/dev/",
          "outputPath": "./dev/public/"
        }
      }
    }

Models
~~~~~~

Data models are defined in JSON files (with a ``.json`` extension). Each
separate JSON file in the ``models/`` folder of your project represents
a single model, analagous to a "class". Models simply contain key/value
pairs indicating their field names and field types.

Example Model: ``Person.json``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: js

    {
      "firstName": "string",
      "lastName": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "created": "datetime"
    }

Example Model: ``Post.json``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: js

    {
      "title": "string",
      "slug": "string",
      // This author field is a foreign key reference to an instance of the
      // Person class, pointing, by default, to the "id" field of that class.
      "author": "fk|Person",
      "draft": "int",
      "content": "content",
      "published": "datetime"
    }

Field Types
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following field types are available at present, and have their
equivalent SQLite and Python data types:

+-------------+--------------+---------+---------+
| Field Type  | Description  | SQLite  | Python  |
+=============+==============+=========+=========+
| ``string``  | Text         | ``TEXT` | ``unico |

+-------------+--------------+---------+---------+
| ``int``     | Signed       | ``INT`` | ``int`` |
|             | integer      |         |         |
+-------------+--------------+---------+---------+
| ``date``    | A date       | ``DATE` | ``datet |
|             | object, with | `       | ime.dat |
|             | year, month  |         | e``     |
|             | and day info |         |         |
+-------------+--------------+---------+---------+
| ``datetime` | Similar to   | ``DATET | ``datet |
| `           | the date     | IME``   | ime.dat |
|             | object, but  |         | etime`` |
|             | with more    |         |         |
|             | detailed     |         |         |
|             | timestamp    |         |         |
|             | information  |         |         |
+-------------+--------------+---------+---------+
| ``float``   | A            | ``DOUBL | ``float |
|             | floating-poi | E``     | ``      |

|             | number       |         |         |
+-------------+--------------+---------+---------+
| ``content`` | A special    | ``TEXT` | ``unico |
|             | instance of  | `       | de``    |
|             | ``string``   |         |         |
|             | that         |         |         |
|             | receives     |         |         |
|             | Markdown     |         |         |
|             | content if   |         |         |
|             | data is      |         |         |
|             | specified in |         |         |
|             | Markdown     |         |         |
+-------------+--------------+---------+---------+
| ``fk``      | A foreign    | ``TEXT` | N/A     |
|             | key to       | `       |         |
|             | another      |         |         |
|             | model        |         |         |
|             | instance     |         |         |
+-------------+--------------+---------+---------+

Primary Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each model is automatically given an ``id`` field of type ``TEXT`` which
is used as its primary key. This is automatically assigned for instances
of models (see the section on **Data** next).

Foreign Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When specifying a field as a foreign key to another model, the source
class' field, by default, is created as a ``TEXT`` field, because the
default auto-generated ``id`` field for a class is of type ``TEXT``.
This allows us to create instances that refer to other instances, simply
by way of their filename.

Content Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each model may contain at most one field of the ``content`` type.
Ultimately, HTML content is stored in this field. If a class instance is
written in Markdown format, the Markdown content outside of the

Data
~~~~

Data instances are either defined in JSON or Markdown files (with
``.json``, ``.md`` or ``.markdown`` file extensions). The ``data/``
folder is primarily comprised of subfolders - each one representing a
specific model, as defined in the ``models/`` folder.

The name of the file, without its extension, is used as the **primary
key** or ``id`` field value for the model instance.

Example Data: ``michael.json``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following on from our ``Person`` model example earlier, we could have an
instance named ``michael.json``, whose primary key (``id`` field) will
be ``michael``:

.. code:: js

    {
      "firstName": "Michael",
      "lastName": "Anderson",
      "email": "manderson@gmail.com",
      // Under the hood, Statik uses Python's dateutil library for parsing date/time
      // values. See https://dateutil.readthedocs.org/en/stable/
      "created": "2016-04-22 14:04"
    }

Example Data: ``my-first-post.md``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following instance of a ``Post`` object shows how one can construct
a post using Markdown, with a JSON *preamble* containing the relevant
metadata to populate the remaining fields of the post.

.. code:: markdown

    ===
    {
      "title": "My first post!",
      "slug": "my-first-post",
      "author": "michael",
      "draft": 0,
      "published": "2016-04-22 14:30"
    }
    ===

    # Welcome
    Welcome to Michael's first post!

    ## Here's a sub-heading
    This content is written in Markdown format. It will automatically be parsed,
    converted into HTML, and inserted as the value of the first field in
    the `Post` model of type `content` (which, happens to be the field named
    `content`).

Templates
~~~~~~~~~

Templates are specified using
`Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`__ syntax, which is very
similar to `Django's <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ templating
syntax. Templates are defined as HTML files (file extension ``.html``)
within the ``templates/`` directory of your project.

Context
^^^^^^^

When rendering your templates, a context is present, depending on the
configuration of the **view** that refers to your template. This allows
you to pass variables and class instance data into your template for
rendering. See the documentation on **views** for more details.

Filters
^^^^^^^

Only the following basic filters are supplied at present. Custom filter
support is planned for a future release of Statik. These are invoked
using `standard Jinja 2 filter
syntax <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#filters>`__.

-  ``date``: Converts a variable of type ``date`` or ``datetime`` into a
   string using the supplied format. Argument: an
   ``strptime``/``strftime`` format specifier. See the ```strftime()``
   and ``strptime()``
   Behavior <https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior>`__
   documentation.
-  ``slug``: Converts the supplied parameter into a slug (all lowercase,
   with special characters and spaces replaced by dashes). For example,
   the string ``Hello world!`` will be converted into the slug
   ``hello-world``.

Views
~~~~~

Views are the glue that hold your templates and data together. They
define which templates to render for which of your web site's paths, and
what data to supply to those templates. Views are stored in JSON format
(with extension ``.json``) in your project's ``views/`` directory.

Example: ``home.json``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example home page, which simply renders a basic template and supplies
that template with the data of the latest 10 posts (ordered from most
recent to least), is shown as follows.

.. code:: js

    {
      // Render /index.html
      "path": "/",
      // Find the template called "home.html" in the "templates/" directory.
      "template": "home.html",
      // Context data, whose contents will be supplied into the "home.html"
      // template during rendering.
      "data": {
        // The "title" variable will be supplied as-is to the template.
        "title": "Welcome to my blog",
        // The "posts" variable will first be recognised as an object, and if the
        // special "$" field is present, Statik will know to first execute that
        // as a SQL query to fetch the data to populate this field. Returned rows
        // from the SQL query will be converted into Python dictionaries,
        // where the "fields" parameter below indicates the order in which Statik
        // can expect the relevant field names.
        "posts": {
          "$": "SELECT id, slug, published, title, author, content FROM Post WHERE draft=0 ORDER BY published DESC LIMIT 10",
          "fields": ["id", "slug", "published", "title", "author", "content"]
        }
      }
    }

Example: ``posts.json``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When, for example, we want to automatically render all of the instances
of the ``Post`` class at different URLs, we can supply a view as
follows.

.. code:: js

    {
      // This is a model-based view, referring specifically to the "Post" model.
      "model": "Post",
      // Path specs are supplied as Jinja2 templates. When rendering, all of the
      // fields will be select from the specified model, and by default, all
      // instances of the model will be selected. This path spec is recomputed
      // for each instance of the model rendered. By default, the instance is
      // passed into the path spec template, where its variable is named according
      // to its model name. For example, an instance of the "Post" class will
      // be called "post"; an instance of the "Person" class will be called
      // "person"; an instance of another class called "MusicGenre" will be
      // called "musicGenre" (using camelCase).
      "path": "/{{ post.published|date('%Y/%m/%d') }}/{{ post.slug }}",
      // Uses the "fullpost.html" template file in the templates/ directory.
      "template": "fullpost.html"
    }
