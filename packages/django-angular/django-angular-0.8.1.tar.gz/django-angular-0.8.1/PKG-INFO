Description: ============== django-angular ==============
        
        Let Django play well with AngularJS
        ===================================
        
        Please help us testing the upcoming release 0.8.0.
        
        From a functional point of view, almost nothing changed between 0.7.16
        and 0.8.0 with one *big* exception:
        
        **djangular has been renamed to djng** and **ng.django-...** has been
        renamed to **djng-...**. This was requested by many users since it:
        
        -  caused a naming conflict with another Django app named the same and
        -  the identifier "djangular" by many users was seen as a bad choice for
           this Django app.
        -  violated the AngularJS principle that only their modules shall be
           prefixed with ``ng``.
        
        Please read https://github.com/jrief/django-angular/issues/35 for the
        preceded discussion on this topic.
        
        0.7.16 (latest)
        ---------------
        
        -  Ready for Django-1.9.
        -  Fixed: Non-ascii characters were not being processed correctly by
           ``django.http.request.QueryDict.init``.
        -  In JavaScript, replaced ``console.log`` by ``$log.log``.
        -  Use decimal base on invocation of ``parseInt``.
        -  Use square brackets to access scope members, which otherwise won't
           support fields containing ``-``.
        -  templatetag ``load_djng_urls`` has been removed.
        -  For CRUD, check if request method is allowed.
        -  Fixed djngError directive, when using AngularJS-1.3.
        -  Added support for ``ngMessages``, as available with AngularJS-1.3.

        -  Client side form validation for Django forms using AngularJS.
        -  Let an AngularJS controller call methods in a Django view - kind of
           Javascript RPCs.
        -  Manage Django URLs for static controller files.
        -  Three way data binding to connect AngularJS models with a server side
           message queue.
