Description: IOCDOC: Document the configuration of an EPICS IOC
        ==================================================
        
        *iocdoc*: Document the configuration of an EPICS IOC
        
        :docs: http://iocdoc.readthedocs.org
        :git:  https://github.com/prjemian/iocdoc/
        
        The user will provide the directory path (absolute or relative)
        to an EPICS IOC startup command file.  
        The IOC startup file will specify the starting point to discover
        the configuration of each IOC.
        
        This code will parse the startup command file
        and discover the commands and databases used to start the IOC.
        An attempt is made to read the database files.  This program will
        report if a file or database is not found.
        
        The goal is to generate a set of WWW pages with appropriate
        links to standard documentation for all the commands and other
        common support.  Links will be made to any local documentation
        provided in the ./documentation directory of the top level directory.
