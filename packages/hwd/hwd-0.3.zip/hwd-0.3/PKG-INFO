        This package provides APIs for obtaining information about hardware. Currently
        it supports storage and network devices. Main use case is hardware management
        in Librarian_, so it falls fairly short of being useful as a general hardware
        mangement tool. It is also Linux-specific and has not been (and will not be)
        tested on any other platform.
        
        See ``examples`` directory for some usage examples.
        
        Documentation is available `on Read The Docs <http://hwd.readthedocs.org/>`_.
