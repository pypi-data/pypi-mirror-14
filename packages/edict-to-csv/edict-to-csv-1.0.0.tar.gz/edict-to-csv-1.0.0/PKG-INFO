Description: edict-to-csv
        ============
        
        edict-to-csv is a set of small command-line utilities for converting EDICT
        dictionaries into delimited text (CSV). As with many Unix commands, these
        programs simply read from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
        Two programs are provided:
        
        * cedict-to-csv(1)
        * edict1-to-csv(1)
        
        edict1-to-csv converts dictionary entries from the original EDICT1 format used
        by the JMdict/EDICT project. It does not handle the EDICT2 format or subsequent
        XML-based formats.
        
        cedict-to-csv converts dictionary entries from the CEDICT project, as used by
        CC-CEDICT. To use this program, you must have "pinyin-dec" software installed.
        This will reformat Pinyin entries to use proper diacritics.
        
        CSV entries take the following format::
        
            FORM1|FORM2|TRANSLITERATION|DEFINITION
        
        In the case of EDICT, the second field is always empty. For CEDICT, the second
        field contains the simplified Chinese form.
        
        The programs included are written as Unix-style command-line utilities. The
        program modules are also completely accessible through Python so all program
        functions can be easily called by other programs. The programs are written in
        Python 3 and are being made available under the MIT License.
        
        Example Usage
        -------------
        
        You can convert the Japanese EDICT dictionary like this::
        
            $ cat edict.utf8 | edict1-to-csv > edict.csv
        
        If it is compressed and in EUC-JP encoding, you may have to convert it::
        
            $ zcat edict.gz | iconv -f EUC-JP -t UTF-8 | edict1-to-csv > edict.csv
        
        You can convert CC-CEDICT like this::
        
            $ cat cedict.txt | cedict-to-csv > cedict.csv
        
        If you try to use this program without pinyin-dec installed, you will see::
        
            $ cat cedict.txt | cedict-to-csv > cedict.csv
            cedict-to-csv: pinyin_dec not available!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install this software the old way with setup.py::
        
            # python3 setup.py install
        
        Or if you have pip installed, that is the better way.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        This software includes Unix manual pages, which are installed with the program
        files. By typing "man cedict-to-csv" or "man edict1-to-csv", you can review the
        documentation for each program included here.
