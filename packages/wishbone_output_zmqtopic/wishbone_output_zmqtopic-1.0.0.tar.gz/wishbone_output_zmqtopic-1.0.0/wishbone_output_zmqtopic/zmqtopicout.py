class ZMQTopicOut(Actor):

    '''**Publishes data to one or more ZeroMQ Topic subscribe modules.**

    Expects wishbone.input.topic modules to take the initiative and connect to
    this module.  The clients subscribe to a topic of interest.  When multiple
    subscribers subscriber to the same topic, they will all receive the same
    messages resulting into a fanout messaging pattern.

    Parameters:

        - selection(str)("@data")
           |  The part of the event to submit externally.
           |  Use an empty string to refer to the complete event

        - port(int)(19283)
           |  The port to bind to.

        - timeout(int)(1)
           |  The time in seconds to timeout when connecting.

        - topic(str)("")*
           |  The default topic to use when none is set in the header.


    Queues:

        - inbox
           |  Incoming events submitted to the outside.
