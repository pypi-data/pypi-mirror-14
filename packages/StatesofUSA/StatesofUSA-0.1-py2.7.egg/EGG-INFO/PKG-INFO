Description: ##StatesofUSA##
        
        A REST API to return names of the states of U.S.A. This API is built on Flask-restful.
        
        **Follow the steps below to create a REST app on your Linux machine.**
        
        Make sure you have installed python-pip
        First create a virtial environment using pip.
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
        
        Create an evironment of your own. Use a separate folder where you want to have the virtual setup.
        Here I'm creating a folder _statesofusa_env_ then a _venv_ within.
        
            $ mkdir statesofusa_env
            $ cd statesofusa_env
            $ virtualenv venv
            
            New python executable in venv/bin/python
            Installing distribute............done.
        
        Now enter the virtual environment
        
            $ . venv/bin/activate
        
        Once this is done, you will be inside the virtual mode. (notice the prompt shows a `venv` environment)
        Now install Flask and Flask-restful
            
            $ pip install Flask
            $ pip install flask-restful
            
        Once you have done that. All your requirements are ready.
        You now have to get the **[StatesofUSA](https://github.com/ishammi/StatesofUSA/)** git repository.
        
            $ git clone git@github.com:<your_git_username>/StatesofUSA.git
            
        Now to run RESTapi server. Run the _main.py_ file
        
            $ cd statesofusa/
            $ python main.py
            * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
            * Restarting with reloader
        
        Congratulations.. Your Flask REST server is up and running in the local machine on port 5000.
        However the API is routed to the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/states/`
        For convinience, we have hard coded few authorization parameters. Use the token '38c50d14-436b-4e3e-b447-e2e9334fea1a' to hit the API from outside the virtual environment. Here's an example
        
            $ curl -H "Authorization:  token  38c50d14-436b-4e3e-b447-e2e9334fea1a" --data "page=1&items_per_page=10"  http://127.0.0.1:5000/states/
