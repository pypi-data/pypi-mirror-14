# 'ec_num_parity_fragments' must be specified.  'ec_type' is chosen from the
# list of EC backends supported by PyECLib.  The ring configured for the
# storage policy must have it's "replica" count configured to
# 'ec_num_data_fragments' + 'ec_num_parity_fragments' - this requirement is
# validated when services start.  'ec_object_segment_size' is the amount of
# data that will be buffered up before feeding a segment into the
# encoder/decoder.  More information about these configuration options and
# supported `ec_type` schemes is available in the Swift documentation.  Please
# refer to Swift documentation for details on how to configure EC policies.
