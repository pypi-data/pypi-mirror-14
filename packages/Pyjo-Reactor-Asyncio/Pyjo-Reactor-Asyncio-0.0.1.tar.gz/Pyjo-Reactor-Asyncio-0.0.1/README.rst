Pyjo-Reactor-Asyncio
====================

Low level event reactor with asyncio support for Pyjoyment.


Pyjoyment
=========

An asynchronous, event driver web framework for the Python programming language.

Pyjoyment provides own reactor which handles I/O and timer events in its own
main event loop but it supports other loops, ie. *libev* or *asyncio*.

See http://www.pyjoyment.net/


asyncio
=======

This module provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code
using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources,
running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.

The asyncio module was designed in PEP3156_. For a motivational primer on
transports and protocols, see PEP3153_.

See http://asyncio.org/


Trollius
========

Trollius is a portage of the asyncio project (PEP3156_) on Python 2.
Trollius works on Python 2.6-3.5.
