# Run 'discoronode.py' program to start processes to execute
# computations sent by this client, along with this program.

# Distributed computing example where this client sends computation to
# remote discoro process to run as remote coroutines. At any time at
# most one computation coroutine is scheduled at a process (due to
# RemoteCoroScheduler). This example shows how to use 'execute' method of
# RemoteCoroScheduler to submit comutations and get their results easily.

# This example can be combined with in-memory processing (see
# 'discoro_client5.py') and streaming (see 'discoro_client6.py') for
# efficient processing of data and communication.
