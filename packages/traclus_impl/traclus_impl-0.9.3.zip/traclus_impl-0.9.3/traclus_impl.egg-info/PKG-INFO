Name: traclus-impl
Version: 0.9.3
Summary: First pass implementation of traclus algorithm.
This works with 2D trajectories. 
See the github for the unit tests and integ tests.

Note that this is being written as a piece of a senior project.
The implementation should functionally work, but the distance
functions need to be sped up and the code should be refactored
for readability.
