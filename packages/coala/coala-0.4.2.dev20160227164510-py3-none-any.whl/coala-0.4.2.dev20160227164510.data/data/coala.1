.SH DESCRIPTION
coala is a simple COde AnaLysis Application. Its goal is to make static code analysis easy while remaining completely modular and therefore extendable and language independent. Code analysis happens in python scripts while coala manages these, tries to provide helpful libraries and provides a user interface. Please visit http://coala.rtfd.org/ for more information or our development repository on https://github.com/coala\-analyzer/coala/.
