only files ending in .yml get loaded so by removing this from the template
we can avoid having the root template loaded

other alternatives include just making 1.yml the template (or 0.yml) and 
symlinking to that

future versions will expand the hostname on load so we should be able to 
have the filename minus the suffix as a template eg job-{filename:03} =>
job-001, job-002
