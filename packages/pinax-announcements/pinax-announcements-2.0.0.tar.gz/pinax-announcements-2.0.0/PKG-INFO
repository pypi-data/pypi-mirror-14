        Pinax
        ------
        
        Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates. 
        This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.
        
        This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.

        ---------------------
        
        ``pinax-announcements`` is a site-wide announcement reusable app for Django.
        
        Some sites need the ability to broadcast an announcement to all of their
        users. pinax-announcements was created precisely for this reason. How you
        present the announcement is up to you as the site-developer. When working with
        announcements that are presented on the website one feature is that they are
        only viewed once. A session variable will hold which announcements an user has
        viewed and exclude that from their display. announcements supports two
        different types of filtering of announcements:
        
        * site-wide (this can be presented to anonymous users)
        * non site-wide (these can be used a strictly a mailing if so desired)
        * members only (announcements are filtered based on the value of
           ``request.user``)
