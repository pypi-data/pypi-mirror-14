        This tool allows you to merge all files that comprise a Python package into
        a single file and be able to use this single file as if it were a package.
        
        Not only will it behave as if it were the original package, but it will also
        show code in exceptions and debug sessions, and will display the right line
        number and file when logging.
        
        Imports will work as usual so if you have a package structure like:
        
        ::
        
            .
            └── [my_package]
                 ├── file_a.py
                 ├── [sub_package]
                 │    ├── file_b.py
                 │    └── __init__.py
                 ├── __init__.py
        
        And with pinliner installed you execute:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ mkdir test
            $ pinliner my_package test/my_package.py
            $ cd test
            $ python
        
        You'll be able to use generated `my_package.py` file as if it were the real
        package:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> import my_package
            >>> from my_package import file_a as a_file
            >>> from my_package.sub_package import file_b
        
        And `__init__.py` contents will be executed as expected when importing
        `my_package` package and you'll be able to access its contents like you would
        with your normal package.
        
        Modules will also behave as usual.
        
        If your package is checking `__name__` for `__main__` it will also work as
        usual.  Although given the fact that we only have 1 file we will no longer be
        able to call other packages/modules directly from the command line to trigger
        code conditioned to `__name__` having `__main__` as its value.
        
        Loader code will automatically compile packages and modules to byte code,
        before running it.  When a module is imported for the first time, or when the
        specific's package/module source (not the whole inlined file) is more recent
        than the current compiled file, a .pyc file containing the compiled code will
        be created in the same directory as the pinlined .py file.
        
        If the byte code is up to date then it will be used instead, thus avoiding a
        recompilation, exactly the same as python normally does, with the only
        exception that all .pyc files will be in the same directory and the filenames
        will include the full path to the original file.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install pinliner globally in your system or use a virtual environment,
        this is how it could be done using a virtual environment:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ virtualenv .venv
            $ source .venv/bin/activate
            $ pip install pinliner
        
        After that you can run the tool with `pinliner`.

        History
        =======
        
        0.2.0 (2016-04-03)
        ------------------
        
        * Add support for incompatible loaders to coexists.
        * Generate and use pyc files for modules.
        * Add support for the filename to be different than the package.
        * Now __main__ works directly from the package as expected.
        
        0.1.1 (2016-03-29)
        ------------------
        
        * Fix missing template file when installing
        * Reduce memory footprint to keep the package structure and code.
        * Include tagging of beginning of files in the output.
        
        0.1.0 (2016-03-27)
        ------------------
        
        * Show code when debugging and on tracebacks
        * Improve internal package and module names
        * Fix line numbers (off by 1)
        * Package's root namespace is no longer polluted by pinliner
        * Original filename for package/modules is stored so it will be reported by
          exceptions and logging.
        
        0.0.1 (2016-03-26)
        ------------------
