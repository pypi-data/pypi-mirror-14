sxdump - backup and restore SX Cluster data
===========================================

Introduction
------------

sxdump analyses SX Cluster's structure and generates two shell scripts in the
current directory: ``sx-backup.sh`` and ``sx-restore.sh``. The first script
will backup all data from the cluster, and the other contains information on
how to recreate the structure, including all volumes, users and ACLs.
**WARNING:** Encrypted volumes are not supported and will be ignored by sxdump.

sxdump uses sxclient library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sxclient) and
requires Python 2.7.


Installation
------------

Since sxdump is available on PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sxdump), it can
be installed with pip.

::

    pip install sxdump

If you don't want to use pip, download sxdump tarball from its PyPI site,
unpack the archive, go to the unpacked directory and run

::

    python setup.py install

Note that the latter installation method requires Python setuptools module,
which can be installed either from the system package repository or by
following the `installation instructions
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions>`_ on
`setuptools PyPI site <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_.


Usage
-----

::

    sxdump --backup-dir DIR sx://[profile@]cluster

where ``DIR`` is a path to a directory which will store the cluster backup.
