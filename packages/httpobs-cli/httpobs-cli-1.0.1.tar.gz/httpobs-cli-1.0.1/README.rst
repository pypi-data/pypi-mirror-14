Mozilla HTTP Observatory :: Command Line Utility
================================================

This repository is for the HTTP Observatory command line utility. If
you're looking for the code for the HTTP Observatory itself, it can be
found `here <https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory>`__.

Getting started with the HTTP Observatory
-----------------------------------------

First, install the client:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install httpobs-cli

And then scan websites to your heart's content, using our hosted
service:

    Modifiers:
        [  -5] Initial redirection from http to https is to a different host, preventing HSTS

If you want additional options, such as to see the raw scan output, use
``httpobs --help``:

::

    $ httpobs --help
    usage: httpobs [options] host

    positional arguments:
      host           hostname of the website to scan

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -d, --debug    output only raw JSON from scan and tests
      -r, --rescan   initiate a rescan instead of showing recent scan results
      -v, --verbose  display progress indicator
      -x, --hidden   don't list scan in the recent scan results
      -z, --zero     show test results that don't affect the final score
