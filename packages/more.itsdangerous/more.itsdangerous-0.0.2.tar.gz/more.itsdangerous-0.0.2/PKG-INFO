        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import morepath
            from more.itsdangerous import IdentityPolicy
        
            class App(morepath.App):
                pass
        
            @App.identity_policy()
            def get_identity_policy():
                return IdentityPolicy()
        
            @App.verify_identity()
            def verify_identity(identity):
                # trust the identity established by the identity policy (we could keep
                # checking if the user is really in the database here - or if it was
                # removed in the meantime)
                return True
        
        See `<http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html>`_ to learn more
        about Morepath's security model and and have
        a look at the commented source code:
        
        `<https://github.com/morepath/more.itsdangerous/blob/master/more/itsdangerous/identity_policy.py>`_
        
        The IdentityPolicy class is meant to be extended because everyone has differing
        needs. It simply provides a way to store the identity as a signed cookie, using
        itsdangerous.
        
        Usage in Development
        --------------------
        
        By default, the cookies created by more.itsdangerous are
        `HttpOnly <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#HttpOnly_cookie>`_ and
        `Secure <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Secure_cookie>`_.
        
        If you have differing needs or if you are running a development server you
        might have to change the identity policy's configuration:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            @App.identity_policy()
            def get_identity_policy():
                # make the cookies work under http, not just https
                return IdentityPolicy(secure=False)
        
        Note that this should only be used in development. In this day and age you do
        not want to transmit cookies over http!
        
        Run the Tests
        -------------
        
        Install tox and run it::
        
            pip install tox
            tox
        
        Limit the tests to a specific python version::
        
            tox -e py27
        
        Conventions
        -----------
        
        More Itsdangerous follows PEP8 as close as possible. To test for it run::
        
            tox -e pep8
        
        More Itsdangerous uses `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_
