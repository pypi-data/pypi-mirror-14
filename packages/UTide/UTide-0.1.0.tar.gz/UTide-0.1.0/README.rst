Python re-implementation of the Matlab package UTide.

Still in heavy development--everything is subject to change!

Note: the user interface differs from the Matlab version, so
consult the Python function docstrings to see how to specify
parameters. Some functionality from the Matlab version is
not yet available.

Installation
============

Download the zip file and unzip it; or, much better,
clone the git repository. In either case, change
your directory to the newly-created ``utide`` distribution
directory.

.. code:: shell

    python setup.py install

or

.. code:: shell

    python setup.py install --user

if you don't want a system-wide installation.

If you want to work on developing the package, then

.. code:: shell

    python setup.py develop

will allow you to test without reinstalling after making
a modification.

Another option is to use

.. code:: shell

    pip install .

If you are using conda and will not be developing the code,
you can install from the IOOS channel. See
https://github.com/ioos/conda-recipes/wiki.

The public functions can be imported using

.. code:: python

    from utide import solve, reconstruct

To test and make sure that the package has been installed
and imported correctly, run:

.. code:: python

    from utide.tests.test_solve import test_roundtrip
    test_roundtrip()

If you have the pytest package installed, you can execute ``python setup.py test``
from within the source directory to run all tests.

A sample call would be

.. code:: python

    from utide import solve

    coef = solve(time, time_series_u, time_series_v,
                 lat=30,
                 nodal=False,
                 trend=False,
                 method='ols',
                 conf_int='linear',
                 Rayleigh_min=0.95,)
