-------------

Released March 10, 2016

- Allowed to specify the HTTP server's host and port on the command
  line.

  JSON.
- Added `Dockerfile`s for the command line script and the HTTP server.

-----------

Released March 6, 2016

- It is now sufficient to specify just the league ID instead of the full
  URL. The latter is still possible, though.
