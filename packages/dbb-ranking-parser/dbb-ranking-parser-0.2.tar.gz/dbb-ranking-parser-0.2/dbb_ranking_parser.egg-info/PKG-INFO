Description: DBB Ranking Parser
        ==================
        
        Extract league rankings from the DBB_ (Deutscher Basketball Bund e.V.)
        website.
        
        This library has been extracted from the web application behind the
        website of the `BTB Royals Oldenburg`_ (a basketball team from
        Oldenburg, Germany) where it has proven itself for many, many years.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python_ 3.4+
        - lxml_
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install this package via pip_:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ pip install dbb-ranking-parser
        
        Because of the dependency on lxml_, this will also require the header
        files for the targeted Python_ version as well as those for libxml2_ and
        libxslt_.
        
        On `Debian Linux`_, one should be able to install these from the
        distribution's repositories (as the 'root' user):
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            # aptitude update
            # aptitude install python3.4-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
        
        Apart from that (for example, if those packages are not yet installed)
        it might be easier to install Debian's pre-built binary packages for
        lxml_ instead:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            # aptitude update
            # aptitude install python-lxml
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To fetch and parse a league ranking, the appropriate URL is required.
        
        It can be obtained on the DBB_ website. On every league's ranking page
        there should be a link to a (non-"XL") HTML print version.
        
        Its target URL should look like this (assuming the league's ID is
        12345):
        ``http://www.basketball-bund.net/public/tabelle.jsp?print=1&viewDescKey=sport.dbb.views.TabellePublicView/index.jsp_&liga_id=12345``
        
        The league ID has to be identified manually in any of the URLs specific
        for that league (ranking, schedule, stats).
        
        For convenience, specifying only the league ID is sufficient; the URL
        will be assembled automatically. (Obviously, this might break when the
        URL structure changes on the DBB website.)
        
        
        Programmatically
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from dbbrankingparser import load_ranking_for_league
        
        
            league_id = 12345
        
            ranking = list(load_ranking_for_league(league_id))
        
            top_team = ranking[0]
            print('Top team:', top_team['name'])
        
        The URL can be specified explicitly, too:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from dbbrankingparser import load_ranking_from_url
        
        
            URL = '<see example above>'
        
            ranking = list(load_ranking_from_url(URL))
        
        Note that a call to a ``load_ranking_*`` method returns a generator. To
        keep its elements around, and also to access them by index, they can be
        fed into a list (as shown above).
        
        
        On the Command Line
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The package includes a command line script to retrieve a league's
        rankings non-programmatically, as JSON. It requires a league ID as its
        sole argument:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ dbb-ranking 12345
            [{"name": "Team ACME", "rank": 1, â€¦}]
