DBB Ranking Parser
==================

Extract league rankings from the DBB_ (Deutscher Basketball Bund e.V.)
website.

This library has been extracted from the web application behind the
website of the `BTB Royals Oldenburg`_ (a basketball team from
Oldenburg, Germany) where it has proven itself for many, many years.


Requirements
------------

- Python_ 3.4+
- lxml_


Installation
------------

Install this package via pip_:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install dbb-ranking-parser

Because of the dependency on lxml_, this will also require the header
files for the targeted Python_ version as well as those for libxml2_ and
libxslt_.

On `Debian Linux`_, one should be able to install these from the
distribution's repositories (as the 'root' user):

.. code:: sh

    # aptitude update
    # aptitude install python3.4-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

Apart from that (for example, if those packages are not yet installed)
it might be easier to install Debian's pre-built binary packages for
lxml_ instead:

.. code:: sh

    # aptitude update
    # aptitude install python-lxml


Usage
-----

To fetch and parse a league ranking, the appropriate URL is required.

It can be obtained on the DBB_ website. On every league's ranking page
there should be a link to a (non-"XL") HTML print version.

Its target URL should look like this (assuming the league's ID is
12345):
``http://www.basketball-bund.net/public/tabelle.jsp?print=1&viewDescKey=sport.dbb.views.TabellePublicView/index.jsp_&liga_id=12345``

The league ID has to be identified manually in any of the URLs specific
for that league (ranking, schedule, stats).

For convenience, specifying only the league ID is sufficient; the URL
will be assembled automatically. (Obviously, this might break when the
URL structure changes on the DBB website.)


Programmatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from dbbrankingparser import load_ranking_for_league


    league_id = 12345

    ranking = list(load_ranking_for_league(league_id))

    top_team = ranking[0]
    print('Top team:', top_team['name'])

The URL can be specified explicitly, too:

.. code:: python

    from dbbrankingparser import load_ranking_from_url


    URL = '<see example above>'

    ranking = list(load_ranking_from_url(URL))

Note that a call to a ``load_ranking_*`` method returns a generator. To
keep its elements around, and also to access them by index, they can be
fed into a list (as shown above).


On the Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package includes a command line script to retrieve a league's
rankings non-programmatically, as JSON. It requires a league ID as its
sole argument:

.. code:: sh

    $ dbb-ranking 12345
    [{"name": "Team ACME", "rank": 1, …}]
