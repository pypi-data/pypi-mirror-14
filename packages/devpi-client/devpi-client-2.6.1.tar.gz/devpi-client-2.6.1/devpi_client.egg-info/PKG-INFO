Description: devpi-client: commands for python packaging and testing
        ===============================================================
        
        The "devpi" command line tool is typically used in conjunction
        with `devpi-server <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi-server>`_.
        It allows to upload, test and install packages from devpi indexes.
        See http://doc.devpi.net for quickstart and more documentation.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.6.1 (2016-04-27)
        ------------------
        
        - fix basic authentication in ``devpi use``.
        
        
        2.6.0 (2016-04-22)
        ------------------
        
        - switching to another server with ``devpi use`` now reuses an existing
          authentication token as well as previously set basic auth and client cert.
        
        - basic authentication is now stored at the devpi-server root instead of the
          domain root, so you can have more than one devpi-server on different paths
          with different basic auth.
        
        - fix issue318: ``devpi test --index`` now accepts a URL, so one can test a
          package from another server without having to run ``devpi use`` first.
        
        
        2.5.0 (2016-02-08)
        ------------------
        
        - the ``user`` command now behaves slightly more like ``index`` to show
          current user settings and modify them.
        
        - fix issue309: print server versions with ``devpi --version`` if available.
          This is only supported on Python 3.x because of shortcomings in older
          argparse versions for Python 2.x.
        
        - fix issue310: with --set-cfg the ``index`` setting in the ``[search]``
          section would be set multiple times.
        
        - fix getjson to work when no index but a server is selected
        
        - allow full urls for getjson
        
        - "devpi quickstart" is not documented anymore and will be removed
          in a later release.
        
        
        2.4.1 (2016-02-01)
        ------------------
        
        - fix issue308: properly handle index reconfiguration in the client API.
          thanks to Jacob Geiger for the report and an initial PR.
        
        
        2.4.0 (2016-01-29)
        ------------------
        
        - fix issue291: transfer file modes with vcs exports.  Thanks Sergey
          Vasilyev for the report.
        
        - new option "--index" for "install", "list", "push", "remove", "upload" and
          "test" which allows to use a different than the current index without using
          "devpi use" before
        
        - set ``index`` in ``[search]`` section of ``pip.cfg`` when writing cfgs, to
          support ``pip search``
