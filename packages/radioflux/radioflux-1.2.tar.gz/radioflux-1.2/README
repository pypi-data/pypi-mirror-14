Packages to work with radio maps using ds9.

Prerequisites: numpy, astropy, pyregion

For pyregion see 

http://leejjoon.github.io/pyregion/users/overview.html

If astropy's prerequisites are installed, you should be able to do

sudo pip install astropy
sudo pip install pyregion

Once these are installed do

sudo python setup.py install

The file radio-flux.ds9 contains analysis commands which should be
added to ds9 ('Analysis' -> 'Load Analysis Commands').

The script radioflux.py can be used to extract fluxes from maps and
ds9 region files externally to ds9 -- run radioflux.py -h for details.
