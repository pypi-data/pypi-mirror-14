        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        - Selecting a user defined field for display in calendar view resulted in an
          error when displaying recurred events.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - No longer use `unittest2` as it was included in Python 2.7.
        
        - Lint JS code.
        
        - Use py.test as new test runner.

        1.6.0 (2014-12-16)
        ==================
        
        - Add new recurrences for recurring events:
        
          * biweekly,
          * nth weekday of month,
          * nth weekday every other month
          * nth weekday from end of month
          * nth weekday from end of other month
          * yearly
        
        - Display actual recurrences in recurrence event listing in master data.
        
        - If there are two reccurred events matching in date, time and category only
          the one is rendered thats recurring event occurres more seldomly.
        
        - Day numbers are now add-links to create a new event for the day.
