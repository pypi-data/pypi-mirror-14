class TrestleTree(Cobweb3Tree):
    """
    The TrestleTree instantiates the Trestle algorithm, which can
    be used to learn from and categorize instances. Trestle adds the ability to
    handle component attributes as well as relations in addition to the
    numerical and nominal attributes of Cobweb and Cobweb/3.

    The alpha parameter is the parameter used for laplacian smoothing of
    nominal values (or whether an attribute is present or not for both
    nominal and numeric attributes). The higher the value, the higher the
    prior that all attributes/values are equally likely. By default a minor
    smoothing is used: 0.001.
        
    The scaling parameter determines whether online normalization of
    continuous attributes is used. By default scaling is used. Scaling
    divides the std of each attribute by the std of the attribute in the
    parent node (no scaling is performed in the root). Scaling is useful to
    balance the weight of different numerical attributes, without scaling
    the magnitude of numerical attributes can affect category utility
    calculation meaning numbers that are naturally larger will recieve
    extra weight in the calculation.

    The beam width parameter detemines the inital beam width used by Beam
    Search to perform structure mapping.  A smaller beam width results in a
    faster search but is not gauranteed to find an optimal match. If beam width
    is set to ``float('inf')`` then A* search will be used, but typically this is
    prohibitively slow.

    The vars_only parameter determines whether the matcher should only allow
    variable attributes to match to other variable attributes or if variable
    attributes should also be allowed to match to constant attributes. This
    setting will generally depend on the domain of the data and whether
    variables mapping to constant attributes makes sense. Allowing the match to
    constant attributes also increases the search space taking more time to find
    matches.
