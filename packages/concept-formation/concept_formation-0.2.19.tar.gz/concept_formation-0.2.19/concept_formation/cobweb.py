        The core cobweb algorithm used in fitting and categorization.

        In the general case, the cobweb algorith entertains a number of sorting
        operations for the instance and then commits to the operation that
        maximizes the :meth:`category utility <CobwebNode.category_utility>` of
        the tree at the current node and then recurses.

        At each node the alogrithm first calculates the category utility of
        inserting the instance at each of the node's children, keeping the best
        two (see: :meth:`CobwebNode.two_best_children
        <CobwebNode.two_best_children>`), and then calculates the
        category_utility of performing other operations using the best two
        children (see: :meth:`CobwebNode.get_best_operation
        <CobwebNode.get_best_operation>`), commiting to whichever operation
        results in the highest category utility. In the case of ties an
        operation is chosen at random.

        In the base case, i.e. a leaf node, the algorithm checks to see if
        creating a new leaf node would result in an increase in category_utility
        (see: :meth:`CobwebNode.cu_for_fringe_split
        <CobwebNode.cu_for_fringe_split>`), if not then the instance is inserted
