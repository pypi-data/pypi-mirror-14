Welcome to PyOpenCL's documentation!
====================================

PyOpenCL gives you easy, Pythonic access to the `OpenCL
<http://www.khronos.org/opencl/>`_ parallel computation API.
What makes PyOpenCL special?

* Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom,
  often called
  `RAII <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization>`_
  in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and
  crash-free code.

* Completeness. PyOpenCL puts the full power of OpenCL's API at your
  disposal, if you wish. Every obscure `get_info()` query and
  all CL calls are accessible.

* Automatic Error Checking. All errors are automatically translated
  into Python exceptions.

* Speed. PyOpenCL's base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties above
  are virtually free.

* Helpful Documentation. You're looking at it. ;)

* Liberal license. PyOpenCL is open-source under the
  :ref:`MIT license <license>`
  and free for commercial, academic, and private use.

Here's an example, to give you an impression:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/demo.py

(You can find this example as
:download:`examples/demo.py <../examples/demo.py>` in the PyOpenCL
source distribution.)

Tutorials
=========

* Gaston Hillar's `two-part article series
  <http://www.drdobbs.com/open-source/easy-opencl-with-python/240162614>`_
  in Dr. Dobb's Journal provides a friendly introduction to PyOpenCL.
* `Simon McIntosh-Smith <http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~simonm/>`_
  and `Tom Deakin <http://www.tomdeakin.com/>`_'s course
  `Hands-on OpenCL <http://handsonopencl.github.io/>`_ contains
  both `lecture slides <https://github.com/HandsOnOpenCL/Lecture-Slides/releases>`_
  and `excercises (with solutions) <https://github.com/HandsOnOpenCL/Exercises-Solutions>`_
  (The course covers PyOpenCL as well as OpenCL's C and C++ APIs.)

Software that works with or enhances PyOpenCL
=============================================

* Two wrappers for `clBLAS <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS>`_ have emerged,
  one by `Eric Hunsberger <https://github.com/hunse/pyopencl_blas>`_ and one
  by `Lars Ericson <http://lists.tiker.net/pipermail/pyopencl/2015-June/001890.html>`_.

* Bogdan Opanchuk's `reikna <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/reikna>`_ offers a
  variety of GPU-based algorithms (FFT, random number generation, matrix
  multiplication) designed to work with :class:`pyopencl.array.Array` objects.

* Gregor Thalhammer's `gpyfft <https://github.com/geggo/gpyfft>`_ provides a
  Python wrapper for the OpenCL FFT library clFFT from AMD.

If you know of a piece of software you feel that should be on this list, please
let me know, or, even better, send a patch!
