django-councilmatic
===========

This is a Django app with core functions for the `Councilmatic family <http://www.councilmatic.org/>`_, a set of web apps for keeping tabs on local city council. It is built upon the open civic data standard, and ultimately makes Councilmatic easier to re-deploy in new cities.

django-councilmatic includes:

- data models for bills, people, organizations, events, and more
- a task to load data from the open civic data api
- views & templates for bill/person/organization/event pages, search, and more

The `Councilmatic family <http://www.councilmatic.org/>`_ includes:

- Philly Councilmatic (the original & first Councilmatic, by Mjumbe Poe. since it preceded django-councilmatic, it does not use django-councilmatic)
- Chicago Councilmatic (launched & built on django-councilmatic)
- New York City Councilmatic (launched & built on django-councilmatic)
