Description: android-sdk-updater
        ===================
        
        A tool for keeping Android dependencies up-to-date in an unattended environment. Pass it your :code:`$ANDROID_HOME` and let it
        update everything in-place. Optionally, provide a list of package names (from :code:`android list sdk --all`) to bootstrap
        your environment.
        
        This tool is especially useful for continuous-integration environments.
