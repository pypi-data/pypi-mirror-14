      -v, --version         Print the version number of this program and exit.      
      
Examples
--------------

To configure the FPGA with a bitstream from a file:

xsflags
=========

    usage: xsflags.py [-h] [-u N] [-b BOARD_NAME] [-j {on,off}] [-f {on,off}]
                      [-r READ] [-v]

    Change configuration flags on an XESS board.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -u N, --usb N         The USB port number for the XESS board. If you only
                            have one board, then use 0.
      -b BOARD_NAME, --board BOARD_NAME
                            ***DEPRECATED*** The XESS board type (e.g., xula2-lx9)
      -j {on,off}, --jtag {on,off}
                            Turn the auxiliary JTAG port on or off.
      -f {on,off}, --flash {on,off}
                            Make the serial flash accessible to the FPGA. (Only
                            applies to the XuLA-50 & XuLA-200 boards.)
      -r, --read            Read the flag settings from the XESS board.
      -v, --version         Print the version number of this program and exit.
      
Examples
------------

To enable the auxiliary JTAG port of a XuLA or XuLA2 board:

    xsflags --jtag on
    
After this, the other XSTOOLs utilities will no longer work because the USB port will no longer
have access to the JTAG port of the FPGA.
In order to re-enable USB access to the JTAG port, use the command:

    xsflags --jtag off
    
The serial flash on the XuLA boards (but **not** the XuLA2 boards) is normally not accessible by the FPGA.
This can be changed with the command:

    xsflags --flash on
    
Once the flash is enabled, the FPGA can no longer reliably use the SDRAM.
To disable the flash (and re-enable the SDRAM), use the command:

    xsflags --flash off
    
The setting of the flash flag has no effect on the XuLA2 boards because the serial flash
is always accessible to the FPGA.
    
To read the current settings of the flags from the board:

    xsflags --read

      
xsusbprg
============

    usage: xsusbprg.py [-h] [-f FILE.HEX] [-u N] [-b BOARD_NAME] [-m] [--verify]
                       [-v]

    Program a firmware hex file into the microcontroller on an XESS board.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FILE.HEX, --filename FILE.HEX
                            The name of the firmware hex file.
      -u N, --usb N         The USB port number for the XESS board. If you only
                            have one board, then use 0.
      -b BOARD_NAME, --board BOARD_NAME
                            The XESS board type (e.g., xula-200)
      -m, --multiple        Program multiple boards each time a board is detected
                            on the USB port.
      --verify              Verify the microcontroller flash against the firmware
                            hex file.
      -v, --version         Print the version number of this program and exit.
      
Examples
------------

To load the microcontroller with the latest firmware:

    xsusbprg
    
To load the microcontroller with the contents of an Intel HEX file:

    xsusbprg -f my_uc_program.hex
    
To verify the stored microcontroller program against a version stored in an Intel HEX file:

    xsusbprg -f my_uc_program.hex --verify
  
GUI Tool
**************

`gxstools` provides the same functions as the command-line tools, but with a GUI wrapper.
The `Ports` tab allows you to select the USB port you will be working with.
The port and the type of board attached to it are shown in the status bar at the bottom of the tab.
Pressing the `Blink` button will cause the LED to blink on the board attached to the selected USB port.

.. image:: gxstools1.png

The `FPGA` tab is used to download configuration bitstream files into the FPGA.
You can select a bitstream file by:

* Typing the filename directly into the text field.
* Using the `Browse` button to go to a directory and select a bitstream file.
* Using drag-and-drop to drop a file into the text field.

Once a file is entered in the text field, clicking on the downward-pointing arrow will load the
bitstream in the file into the FPGA.

The text field maintains a history of all the files that have been downloaded to the FPGA.
This makes it easy to go back and reload the FPGA with a bitstream.

.. image:: gxstools2.png

The `SDRAM` tab lets you download and upload data to/from the SDRAM.
The data in an Intel HEX file can be downloaded into the SDRAM by entering the file name into the upper text field
and then clicking on the upper downward-pointing arrow.
Similarly, data between the values typed into the `Upper Address` and `Lower Address` fields will be loaded
into the file whose name is entered into the lower text field once the lower downward-pointing arrow is clicked.

.. image:: gxstools3.png

The serial flash can be handled in the same manner as the SDRAM by using the `Flash` tab.
The only additional feature is that the flash can be loaded with an FPGA configuration bitstream
by entering a `.bit` file into the upper text field.

.. image:: gxstools4.png

The `Test` tab is used to run a diagnostic on the board just by clicking the `Test` button

.. image:: gxstools5.png


The `Flags` tab lets you set the various flags for the board.
The current settings for the flags are indicated by the state of the checkboxes.

.. image:: gxstools6.png

The microcontroller can be reprogrammed by entering the name of an Intel HEX file into the text field
of the `uC` tab and clicking on the downward-pointing arrow.
