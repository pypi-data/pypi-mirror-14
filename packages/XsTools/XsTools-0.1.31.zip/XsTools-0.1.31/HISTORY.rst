History
-------

v0.1.31 (2016-03-09) 
---------------------

* Sped-up memory reads & writes from/to the SDRAM.

v0.1.30 (2015-09-02) 
---------------------

* Removed include in README.rst that caused an error generating the documentation.

v0.1.29 (2015-08-10) 
---------------------

* Specifying the board model on the CLI utilities is now case-insensitive.

v0.1.28 (2015-08-09) 
---------------------

* Now supports pyusb versions 1.0.0a and 1.0.0b.
* The utilities only connect to the USB port when they are actively executing
  some function for the attached XESS board. This allows other utilities to
  access the board.
* Added drag-and-drop capability for selecting bitstream and hex files.
* A history of bitstream and hex files is maintained.
* Exceptions caused by pyusb on program termination are now caught and filtered out.

v0.1.27 (2015-07-31) 
---------------------

* Removed scripts in bin directory and placed them in the xstools directory.
* Added entrypoints to generate executables for the XSTOOLs scripts. 
                       
v0.1.26 (2015-06-06) 
---------------------

* Changed distribution to use readthedocs for documentation.
                       
v0.1.25 (2015-06-05) 
---------------------

* Fixed problem where flash and SDRAM couldn't be accessed in gxstools
  because I appended 'bitstream' to the attribute names.
                       
v0.1.24 (2015-03-16) 
---------------------

* Modified usb2serial.py to prevent accidental triggering of serial BREAK.

v0.1.23 (2015-02-03) 
---------------------

* Modified usb2serial.py and xscomm.py to support new serial BREAK command.
* Added .cmd file to initiate each XSTOOLs script in a Windows command window.

v0.1.22 (2015-01-26) 
---------------------

* Modified usb2serial.py to support non-ZPUino use of the USB-to-serial server.

v0.1.21 (2015-01-07) 
---------------------

* Modified setup.py so pyusb < 1.0.0b1 is installed as a dependency since the
  newer 1.0.0bX libraries cause a problem with finding XESS boards on USB ports. 

V0.1.20 (2014-12-17) 
---------------------

* Modified setup.py to include microcontroller firmware hex files for the XESS
  boards. 

V0.1.19 (2014-12-12) 
---------------------

* Modified setup.py so pyusb <= 1.0.0b1 is installed as a dependency since the
  newer 1.0.0b2 library causes a problem with finding XESS boards on USB ports. 

v0.1.18 (2014-12-10) 
---------------------

* Fixed query for XESS USB devices which failed for some USB libraries.

v0.1.17 (2014-11-06) 
---------------------

* Fixed handling of XuLA/XuLA2 boards with old firmware or with the USB-to-JTAG
  path disabled.

v0.1.16 (2014-10-27) 
---------------------

* Added command-line and GUI methods for setting/getting flags in XuLA/XuLA2 boards.
* Enabled loading of .bit files into serial configuration flash via gxstools.
* Updated hex file to newest version of the PIC 18F14K50 firmware.
* Added USB-to-serial bridge server between XuLA board and virtual comm port on PC.
