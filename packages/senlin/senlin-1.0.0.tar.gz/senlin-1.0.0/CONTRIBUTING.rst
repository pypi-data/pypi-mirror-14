Before You Start
================

If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in this page:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Where to Start
==============

Senlin maintains a `TODO` file under the root directory, where developers
can add new items, claim existing items and remove items that are completed.
You may want to check if there are items you can pick by signing your name
there.

Reporting Bugs
==============

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/senlin

Meet the Developers
===================

Real-time communication among developers are mostly done via IRC.
The team is using the #senlin channel on freenode.net.
