        Come experience and build something awesome!
        
        
        
        All endpoints are accessible only via https and are located at `api.probe42.in`
        
        
        ## Authentication
        Once you&#39;ve  [registered your client](http://developer.probe42.in) it&#39;s easy to start requesting data from Probe.
        You will be issued automatically an API key, which you can provide in all your calls.
        
        It is very important to keep your API key as a secret and store it in a
        private and secure location.
        
        Sharing your API key is strictly prohibited.
        The API key is unique to each customer and application.
        
        Pass the API key in the request header \&quot;x-api-key\&quot;.
        
        Given below is an example of the curl command on how to pass the API key in the header:
        
        
        ```
        curl -X GET --header \&quot;Accept: application/json\&quot; --header \&quot;x-api-key: $api_key\&quot; \&quot;https://api.probe42.in/probe_lite/companies\&quot;
        
        ```
        
        ## Limits
        
        Be good. If you are sending too many requests too quickly, you will receive a 429 HTTP response.
        We have rate-limiting set on our servers.
        
        ## Errors
        The following are the typical errors returned:
        
        403 - Forbidden when there&#39;s no api-key supplied, incorrect api-key or
              an incorrect URL is given
        
        422 - Validation errors - for eg., given a wrong CIN format
        
        404 - when a resource is not found
        
        500 - any server side error
        
        503 - timeout errors - if we have some issue in our backend systems
