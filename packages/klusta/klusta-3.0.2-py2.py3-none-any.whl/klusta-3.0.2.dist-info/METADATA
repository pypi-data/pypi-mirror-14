[**klusta**](https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta) is an open source automatic spike sorting package for multielectrode neurophysiological recordings that scales to probes with up to 64 interdependent channels.

We are also working actively on more sophisticated algorithms that will scale to hundreds/thousands of channels. This work is being done within the [phy project](https://github.com/kwikteam/phy), which is still experimental at this point.

## Overview

**klusta** implements the following features:

* **Kwik**: An HDF5-based file format that stores the results of a spike sorting session.
* **Spike detection** (also known as SpikeDetekt): an algorithm designed for probes containing tens of channels, based on a flood-fill algorithm in the adjacency graph formed by the recording sites in the probe.
* **Automatic clustering** (also known as Masked KlustaKwik): an automatic clustering algorithm designed for high-dimensional structured datasets.


## GUI

You will need a GUI to visualize the spike sorting results.

We have developed two GUI programs:

* [**KlustaViewa**](https://github.com/klusta-team/klustaviewa): scales up to 64 channels, well-tested by many users over the last few years. This will be installed if you follow the installation instructions below.
* **phy KwikGUI**: newer project, scales to hundreds/thousands of channels, still experimental. We will add a link when this GUI is ready (probably April 2016).


## Technical details

**klusta** is written in pure Python. The clustering code, written in Python and Cython, currently lives in [another repository](https://github.com/kwikteam/klustakwik2/).


## Quick install guide

**Note**: the installation instructions will be simplified soon.

The following instructions will install both **klusta** and the **KlustaViewa GUI**.

1. Make sure that you have [**miniconda**](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) 64-bit for Python 3.5 installed on your system.
2. [**Download this file**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwikteam/klusta/master/installer/environment.yml).
3. **Open a terminal** in the directory where you saved the file and type `conda env create -n klusta`.
4. **Done**! Now, to use klusta and KlustaViewa, you have to first type `source activate klusta` in a terminal (omit the `source` on Windows), and then call `klusta` or `klustaviewa`. See the documentation for more details.

### Updating the software

To get the latest version of the software, open a terminal and type:

```
source activate klusta  # omit the `source` on Windows
pip install klusta klustaviewa kwiklib --upgrade
```
