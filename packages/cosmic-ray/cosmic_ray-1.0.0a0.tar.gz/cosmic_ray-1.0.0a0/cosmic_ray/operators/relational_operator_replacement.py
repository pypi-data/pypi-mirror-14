"""This module contains mutation operators which replace one
relational operator with another.

For each relational operator we generate a series of classes, one for
each *other* operator. These generated classes mutate nodes by
replaces the first operator with the second.

The generated classes are named `Replace<from-op>With<to-op>` where
`from-op` is the relational operator being replaced and `to-op` is the
replacement operator.
