Grade Change Emailer
====================

This is a simple python script that checks for new grades at the FH
Aachen.

Dependencies
------------

This scripts depends on **Python 3**, the **requests** and the
**BeautifulSoup4** package from python.

Configuration
-------------

Copy the example.ini to default.ini and fill in the necessary details.

Usage
-----

Run the script with ``python3 main.py``. Now everytime the script runs
it checks for new grades and e-mails you about it if that is the case.
Note that the script will always e-mail you the first time the script is
run. If you don't receive an e-mail, you misconfigured it. Go and
recheck all you login data. You might want to schedule this script with
something like **cron** to automate the grade checking.
