Python libraries for the Ceph librados library with use cython instead of ctypes

This a standalone library initially comes from this Ceph PR https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/7621

But can be built against older version of Ceph from 0.80.X (firefly) to 10.1.X (perhaps more not tested)

This is designed for application that want to use a recent python-rados API without upgrading
the whole ceph cluster.

Rados C handles provided by this library canâ€™t be used with the ceph rbd.py or librbdpy.

The API of this python lib will be keep in sync with the upstream Ceph rados.py API.
