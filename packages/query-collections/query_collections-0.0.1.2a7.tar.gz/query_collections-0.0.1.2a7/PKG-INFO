Description: Query Collections
        =================
        
        A set of classes that makes managing JSON objects easier within Python (and more?)
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        When wanting to access an index of a JSON object (or a Python
        dictionary/map), we need to use ['member'] syntax. This is ok for simple
        JSON objects, but let's say you had a complex object andyou wanted a
        deeply nested element, such as:
        
        ::
        
                dict_instance['member'][0]['items'][0]['id']
        
        This is where query collections come in. Right now the supported
        structures are maps (python dictionaries) and lists. Here is how we can
        access the members in each:
        
        Given a k:v map:
        
        .. code::
        
            {
                "population": {
                    "faculty": [
                        {
                            "id": "103902",
                            "name": "Cory",
                            "field": "CS"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": "6789",
                            "name": "Ted",
                        },
                        {
                            "id": "67874",
                            "name": "Mike",
                            "field": "CS"
                        }
                    ],
                    "count": 3,
                    "access_codes": [
                        1, 2, 3
                    ]
                }
            }
        
        This specific instance would be rather difficult to obtain information
        from, and would require a lot of generators and other unnecessary bloat
        to achieve a task as simple as "if there are any users who are faculty,
        return those with a 'field' specified
        
        Here is the naive solution with regular builtin Python functionality:
        
        .. code::
        
                json_obj = ...
                if json_obj.get('population').get('faculty') is not None:
                    matches = [f_member for f_member in json_obj['population']['faculty'] if 'field' in f_member]
                    return matches
                return None_
        
        Here is how we can perform the same operation with a query\_dict:
        
        .. code::
        
                json_obj = query_dict(...)
                matches = json_obj.query("population:faculty:*:field!")
        
        In this example, ``*`` denotes "any member of the list faculty", and
        ``!`` means 'return true if field exist\`. The wildcard operator, by
        default, returns any member who returns a value.
        
        Syntax
        ------
        
        The syntax for queries is very easy to understand! To access a nested
        member of a parent, simply do: parent:child. This can be chained over
        any amount of nesting. Of course this is in itself useful, but with the
        addition of operators, the use case is much, much more clear!
        
        Acceptable operators: - ``*``: Wildcard operator. Returns the list of
        elements at the given index. - ``!``: Exists operator. Returns true if
        the member exists.
        
        Combination of rules is also acceptable: - The wildcard by default stops
        error reporting and returns all matching elements following itself in
        the query string. For example: .query("\*:id!") returns all members of
        the first level where id exists. We can also perform queries by using the
        index operators and prefixing a question mark.
        
        Examples:
        ---------
        
        You may find a list of query examples in the /test directory. This
        includes all current combinations of operators and basic error checking.
        
        query\_dict and query\_list
        ---------------------------
        
        Currently this is all implemented through classes that inherit the dict
        and list class. The only additional functionality of these classes are
        dot access of dictionary members and a 'length'/'len' property of lists.
        
        query\_dict
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Members of the dictionary can be accessed from the dot operator:
        
        ::
        
            >>> obj = query_dict({_
                    "name": "Cory",
                    "stats": {
                        "coolness": "over9000"
                    }
                })
            >>> obj.name
            "Cory"
            >>> obj.stats.coolness
            "over9000"
        
        query len/length
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            >>> mlist = query_list([1,2,3])
            >>> mlist.len
            3
            >>> mlist.length
            3
